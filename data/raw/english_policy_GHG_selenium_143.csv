			China outlines roadmap to build better cities






Updated:
Feb 21,2016 10:11 AM
	    Xinhua












Chinese central authorities on Feb 21 issued guidelines on urban development, two months after leaders met for the Central Urban Work Conference and promised to make China’s sprawling cities more livable, efficient and green.
The document, from the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, set the basic principles, key tasks and targets for future urban development and management, aiming to ensure that cities are “orderly constructed, properly developed, and efficiently operated”.
The last time China held a meeting like the Central Urban Work Conference was in 1978, when only 18 percent of the population lived in cities. That had increased to 56.1 percent by the end of 2015.
Urbanization in the past few decades has brought about significant social and economic changes in China, spawning problems including traffic jams, pollution and compromised public safety.
Such urban ills have provoked public ire, putting pressure on city planners to find solutions.
Chen Zhenggao, minister of housing and urban-rural development, said the document was drafted based on careful research by its ministry and 29 other related departments.
The guidelines said China will limit cities from growing beyond the means of their natural resources and environment.
Currently, Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing municipalities all have populations exceeding 20 million. Cities like Tianjin, Guangzhou and Shenzhen each have more than 10 million.
Priority will be given to the protection of farmland, while land for construction use will be “properly allocated”. The country plans to take around five years to inspect and clear up illegal construction.
It also called for city planners to differentiate cities with urban landscape based on local characteristics.
Aside from the exterior of buildings, factors including resource and energy conservation as well as environmental protection should also be taken into account in the process of designing and constructing, the guidelines said.
As part of efforts to provide low-income urban residents with affordable housing, China aims to complete renovation of rundown urban areas and dilapidated housing by 2020.
China will also improve urban planning and construction of infrastructure, both underground and overground. Construction standards and project quality will be raised, the guidelines said.
To ease traffic jams in the cities, China looks to expand public transport network such as buses and railways. By 2020, China aims to raise the penetration of public transport to 40 percent in megacities, 30 percent in big cities and 20 percent in medium- and small cities.
Efforts will be intensified to cut pollutant emission in the cities with increasing supply of clean fuel to improve energy structure, the document said.
It also called for developing smart cities through various Internet technologies, such as big data and cloud computing, aiming to upgrade urban management and services.

Coordinated urban and rural development was urged in the designated area of 7,437 square kilometers, with extra attention to be paid to the construction of urban villages and city peripheries. 
According to the plan, the Guangzhou government will control the population of permanent urban residents within 18 million and limit urban construction land within 1,772 square kilometers. No new districts or development zones of any kind will be allowed outside the approved area. 
The State Council also urged the Guangzhou government to improve urban infrastructure, protect historic and cultural sites and take measures to build an energy-saving and environmentally-friendly city.

Updated:
Feb 14,2016 4:46 PM

The State Council urged reinforced efforts to protect and take care of “left-behind” children in rural areas in a document issued on Feb 14. 
The policy targets those below the age of 16 with both parents going leaving for non-farming jobs or with one parent working away and the other incapable of guardianship. 
The State Council called for the establishment of a work system, with families, governments, schools and social groups taking part, which can provide care and protection to “left-behind children”. A rescue mechanism that includes intervention measures such as mandatory reporting, crisis management and assistance evaluation will prevent infringements on the rights of these children. 
It is expected that, by 2020, China will improve laws and regulations regarding child protection, and create a safer environment for children to grow up in. In this way, the number of “left-behind children” will be reduced. 
The government will provide more assistance such as granting families of migrant workers urban citizenship or subsidies in housing or education. Rural migrant workers are also encouraged to return to their hometowns and start their own businesses.

On Jan 13, the State Council issued a circular regarding efforts to further improve the country’s academic environment and promote an innovation-driven development strategy.
The goal is to make a breakthrough by 2020 in key areas of the scientific and technological system that is significant to academic innovation, the State Council said.
Developments in academic environment will be made in scientific research, talent cultivation, academic management, and academic appraisal.
To do this, the government’s function will be transformed from scientific management to innovation service with respect for scientific and technological workers who will be in dominant positions in academic development, according to the circular.
Under the new policy, instead of being hindered by all kinds of unnecessary reviews and appraisals, scientific and technological workers will be able to have much more time and energy to devote to scientific research.
Organizational structure and management system of scientific and technological institutions will be reformed to reduce bureaucracy and improve openness, coordination, efficiency and innovation.
The new policy will also grant more decision-making rights to colleges and scientific and technological institutions on scientific research projects, personnel and finance management, scientific research direction, and international exchanges.
For major national labs and scientific research bases, the government will give continuing support so that frontline scientific research can continue without interruption.
In addition, reform test runs will be made in the personnel system of major national labs and scientific research bases to establish an internationally competitive talent management system and attract top-level intellectuals.
Strict academic credit system and records will be established and more efforts will be made to punish academic misconduct. People involved in academic misconduct will be limited in project application, promotion, and rewards, according to the circular.

			China to strengthen poverty relief in old revolutionary base areas






Updated:
Feb 2,2016 10:39 AM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China will increase poverty alleviation in old revolutionary base areas, mostly in the country’s less-developed central and western parts, to boost local growth and improve people’s livelihood, an official document said.
The revolutionary bases are regarded as the roots of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and army but have been lagging behind the country’s rapid economic progress in the past few decades due to factors such as poor infrastructure and unfavorable geographic positioning.
China hopes to change this as it wages a decisive battle against poverty with the ambitious goal of lifting its 70 million poor people above the poverty line by 2020.
A guideline released on Feb 1 by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council further showed the resolution of policymakers.
To break development bottlenecks, the government will help improve infrastructure, develop energy resources and foster special industries, as well as provide more fiscal and financial support, according to the guideline.
Transport networks, including expressways and railroads, will be expanded in the regions; electricity and web services will be improved; more water conservation projects will be built.
State-owned and private firms will be allowed to explore resources including coal, oil and shale gas in those areas, and build plants powered by clean energy, such as hydropower, wind power and solar energy.
Local governments will be encouraged to develop special farm produce and tourism.
Through those measures, the government aims to make the old revolutionary base areas prosperous by 2020, with an improved local economy and growth rate in people’s income higher than the national average.

			China to build modern standardization system by 2020






Updated:

	    english.gov.cn












On Dec 30, the State Council issued a circular regarding the construction and development plan of a national standardization system by 2020.
Standards are fundamental to economic activities and social development. They are also the basis for national governance and the modernization of governance, the circular said.
Despite rapid development since China’s reform and opening-up, standardization still lags behind economic and social development.
The plan, part of the efforts to promote the economy to a medium-to-high level, involves standards in sectors such as agriculture, industry, service industry, education, food, medical care, environment protection, culture, and government administration.
Take the agricultural industry for example. In order to promote agriculture modernization, the plan will establish modern agricultural production standards that cover production, processing, and circulation.
The standards will be made not only by the government but also the market and the average period of making standards will be narrowed down to less than 24 months, according to the plan.
A total of 9,000 standard items will be made in major sectors concerning agricultural commodity security, energy conservation and emission reduction, intelligent manufacturing and equipment upgrades, and new materials.

The State Council approved an overall plan (2011-2020) for the development of Daqing, Northeast China’s Heilongjiang province, in a guideline published on Jan 27, calling for integrated planning and management of the 5,107 square kilometers of designated planning area.
Highlighting the city’s role as a major petroleum and petrochemical industry base, the guideline urged stricter regulation on petrochemical enterprises and hazardous chemical warehouses.
It suggested focusing on the development of counties and townships with good basic conditions, optimizing the layout of townships and villages, and promoting agricultural industrialization and modernization in rural areas. 
By 2020, the permanent resident population in the central urban area should be kept within 1.5 million, and urban land used for construction should be within 223 square kilometers, said the guideline. 
It prohibited setting up development areas or new towns or districts beyond the scope of the designated land for construction.
The guideline also suggested utilizing urban underground space, improving land utilization efficiency and protecting arable land. 
To improve the infrastructure system of the city, the guideline proposed planning infrastructure construction by following a green and low-carbon concept, and further perfecting transportation infrastructure to promote integration with neighboring cities Harbin and Qiqihar.
To build Daqing into a resource-conserving and environment-friendly city, the guideline suggested improving utilization efficiency of water resources and strengthening protection of natural conservation areas, wetland and water supply areas. 
The guideline also called for protection of historic culture, characteristic landscape and industrial heritage, underscoring protection of cultural relics such as the Baijinbao site and the First Oil Well of Daqing.

			China to fast-track FTA strategy






Updated:
Dec 17,2015 2:40 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued a guideline on Dec 17 urging a speedier establishment of free trade areas (FTA), with an ultimate goal of forging a global FTA network. 
Underlining the significance of stepping up the FTA strategy, the guideline said that it is an important part of a new round of reform and opening up, a requirement for adapting to economic globalization and an inevitable choice for reform and establishing an open economic system. 
The guideline urges sticking to the decisive role of the market in resource allocation and ensuring that the government can play its role better, while making use of international and domestic markets. 
The guideline also said that efforts should be stepped up to implement a more active FTA strategy by further opening up free trade areas, taking part in framing international rules and expanding reform.
While the short-term goal is to speed up ongoing FTA negotiations and establish free trade zones with neighboring countries and regions, the guideline said that the long-term goal is to forge a global FTA network that further covers countries along the route of the Belt and Road Initiative and other important countries. 
The guideline stressed that high-level free trade zones should be established by further opening trade of goods and the service industry, broadening investment access and actively participating in FTA negotiations. 
It also called for more convenience for trade as well as exit and entry of employees of Chinese enterprises overseas. 
To broaden investment access, it urged further opening the investment market, reforming the foreign capital management system, and optimizing the foreign investment environment. 
Better market access and investment protection conditions should be created for Chinese investors to “go global”, and monetary cooperation with free trade partners should be strengthened to facilitate trade and investment, added the guideline. 
In terms of FTA negotiations, the guideline suggested speeding up negotiations on such new issues as intellectual property protection, environmental protection, e-commerce, competition policies and government procurement.
To facilitate trade, the guideline suggested carrying out the “single-window” system for international trade, simplifying customs clearance procedures, and promoting paper-free inspection and quarantine declaration. 
The difficult problems in FTA negotiations can be tested in pioneering free trade zones such as Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone in advance to provide a basis for negotiations, said the guideline. 
To speed up implementing the FTA strategy, the guideline called on the Ministry of Commerce and related authorities to frame action plans and establish coordination mechanisms.

			State Council approves business license reform plan in Shanghai






Updated:
Dec 29,2015 4:43 PM
	    english.gov.cn












On Dec 29, the State Council issued a reply to the proposal for pilot reforms of business licensing in Shanghai, approving tests in Pudong New District.
The tests will allow companies to get their business licenses before getting administrative permits, a step to create a more favorable and convenient business environment and promote mass entrepreneurship and innovation.
The move will streamline administrative approvals, promote innovation and entrepreneurship, inject dynamism into the economy, and create legislative, international, and convenient business environment, offering precedents to further reform the administrative system nationwide, the State Council said.
The pilot reform in Pudong New District involves 116 administrative approvals.
Administrative approvals on issues such as used motor vehicle appraisal and assessment and outdoor advertising will be canceled, and companies will be able to operate immediately after receiving their business licenses.
Administrative approvals on other issues, such as processing trade contracts, will require paperwork from companies before they can start operations. 
Administrative approvals on issues such as business license of motor vehicle maintenance cannot be abolished for the time being, but companies can get business permits by promising the government that they meet the approval qualifications required by the government and handing in materials.
In addition, for administrative approvals regarding public security, environmental protection, and people’s life and property security, the government will strengthen management of market access and risk control.
Regulation measures will also be taken as authorities will set up credit records and “black lists” to supervise companies. Industry disciplines and standards stipulated by industrial associations as well as social supervision are also encouraged to regulate the market, according to the plan.
Previously, a company was required to get administrative permits before receiving a business license from the industry and business department of the government.

China will strengthen support for consumer services to upgrade the consumption structure and bolster economic growth, according to a guideline issued by the State Council. 
Several key sectors, including health care, senior citizen care, tourism, sports, hotels and catering, as well as education and training services will be prioritized, said the guideline. 
The guideline is China’s first such policy document to specifically target consumer services, improving infrastructure for public services and building a better consumption environment for both domestic and international customers. 
Consumer services will be encouraged to expand to rural areas, information infrastructure construction in rural areas will be accelerated, and private and overseas capital is welcome to invest in the elder care industry. 
More land and price support will be provided, including favorable land policies for senior citizen care, health care and household services, and lowered transaction card fees in services such as catering. 
The government will work to improve the business and consumption environment through strengthened supervision, better intellectual property rights protection and crackdowns on fake goods. 
Given the continued slowdown, China is counting on domestic consumption to replace old economic engines and prop up growth. The economy expanded 6.9 percent year on year in the first three quarters of 2015, the lowest reading since the second quarter of 2009.

Starting from the spring term of 2016, China will unify the basic funds per student for public use, and grant subsidies to urban and rural compulsory education schools (including private schools) no less than the stipulated amount. Subsidies will be raised for boarding schools, schools with access to a heating system in northern China, and small schools. 
Starting from the spring term of 2017, students receiving compulsory education in both urban and rural areas will be exempt from tuition and incidentals, while provided with free textbooks. In addition, boarding students from poor families will receive subsidies to cover their living expenses.
To provide a safer environment for students, the authorities also support public schools in rural areas to rebuild and expand buildings. For those in central and western areas, the cost will be equally divided between the central government and local authorities.
In addition, the guideline stipulates that teachers at compulsory education schools in central and western areas and in parts of eastern areas will be financially guaranteed, with governments at provincial and county level making sure teachers are paid in full and on time. Educational departments will give strong support to those working in poor and remote areas and low-performing schools.

			State Council issues guideline to boost role of consumption






Updated:

A guideline to further boost consumption as a key component in driving economic development was issued by the State Council on Nov 23. 
The structure of consumption is being upgraded, the guideline said, which will bring new opportunities and spaces for development in fields such as infrastructure and public services. 
Aimed at promoting consumption in care for the elderly, domestic and health services, the guideline emphasized boosting information goods and services, rising consumer spending on leisure and tourism, an added impetus to green consumption, keeping property consumption stable, and encouraging people to spend more on education, culture, and sports. 
To achieve this, the guideline insisted that a set of fair, transparent and open market rules should ensure the correct environment to foster fair competition. 
The government should deepen reforms in education, medication, elderly care and culture to encourage private investment in such areas, the guideline said. 
Meanwhile, the government needs to promptly implement reforms to the household registration system and relax controls over the transfer of household registration in order to eliminate barriers between the urban and rural areas to boost consumption, the guideline said. 
The government will work to improve the credit rating system, put in place a national unified system of codes for rating credit, and establish a platform for sharing and exchanging information on credit, the guideline said. 
In addition, the government will strengthen monitoring, tracking and recall systems to ensure the safety and quality of consumer goods, severely punish the production and sale of counterfeit and shoddy goods, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers, the guideline said.

			Annex: The Work Plan for Carrying Out the Pilot Reform of the Negative List System for Market Access






Updated:
Nov 12,2015 5:22 PM
	    english.gov.cn












Article One 
According to the requirements of the “Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform” that “we will implement a unified market access system; and on the basis of making a negative list, all kinds of market players may enter areas not on the negative list on an equal basis and according to the law,” as well as the “Opinions of the State Council on Enhancing Fair Play in the Market and Keeping the Market in Normal Order” (State Council Doc. No. 20 [2014]) concerning “the reform on the market access system”, the State Council has decided to implement the pilot negative list system for market access in some selected areas of China. The plan is hereby formulated for the purpose of promoting the reform coordinately in a proper order.
Article Two

			Government approves overall development plan for Hohhot






Updated:
Nov 17,2015 4:39 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council approved an overall plan (2011-2020) for the development of Hohhot, capital of North China’s Inner Mongolia autonomous region, in an official document published on Nov 17, underscoring the importance of coordinated development of urban and rural areas. 
In the document, the State Council called on the local government to carry out integrated planning and management of the 2,176.7 square kilometers of the city’s planning area designated in the overall plan, focus on the development of counties, townships and villages with great potential for growth, and gradually improve the living conditions of villagers while preserving some characteristics of the countryside. 
Construction of infrastructure and public service facilities should be expanded from urban areas to rural areas to promote equal public services, said the document. 
As the political, economic and cultural center of Inner Mongolia, Hohhot is not only one of the national famous historical and cultural cities designated by the State Council, but also a key city in the border area of northern China, noted the document. 
The State Council also called for reasonable control of the city size. It said that the permanent resident population in the central urban area should be kept within 2.58 million, and urban land used for construction should be kept within 310 square kilometers by 2020. 
Intercity transportation infrastructure, such as highways, railways and airports, should be further improved to relieve the pressure of regional transit traffic, the document added. 
Hohhot should be built as a resource-conserving and environment-friendly city by shutting down outdated production facilities, controlling emission of pollutants, tightening air pollution controls and supporting construction of green buildings, said the document.
The State Council also called on the local government to work out a specific plan for protecting the city’s status as a famous historical and cultural city, by preserving historical and cultural heritages, areas and buildings, focusing particularly on the Zhaojun Tomb and other cultural relics as well as their surroundings.
The Zhaojun Tomb is said to be the grave of Wang Zhaojun (about 52 to 15 BC), a commoner woman from the Han Empire who was married to a nomadic chieftain to establish friendly relations.

			The Opinions of the State Council on Implementing the Negative List System for Market Access






Updated:
Nov 12,2015 5:16 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The people’s governments of all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government, all ministries and commissions of the State Council and all institutions directly under the State Council:
According to the requirements of the “Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Some Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform” and the decisions and arrangements of the State Council, we hereby give our opinions on implementing the negative list system for market access as follows: 
I. Significance

1. Definition of the negative list system for market access.
The negative list system for market access refers to a series of institutional arrangements where the State Council clarifies in a list the sectors, areas and businesses prohibited or restricted from the market within the territory of the People’s Republic of China and local governments at all levels take corresponding management measures in accordance with the law. All kinds of market players may enter sectors, areas and businesses not on the negative list on an equal basis and according to the law.
2. Implementing the negative list system for market access is the important basis for the market to play a decisive role in the allocation of resources.
By implementing the negative list system for market access, we give market players more initiative. It helps to put autonomy of market players into practice and stimulate the market’s vitality, form a market environment in which all kinds of market players have equal access to the factors of production according to the law and participate in competition on an open, fair and just footing, and establish a unified, open, competitive and orderly modern market system. It will provide more space for the market to play a decisive role in the allocation of resources. 
3. Implementing the negative list system for market access is the intrinsic requirement for better playing the role of the government. 
By implementing the negative list system for market access, we make clear the boundaries of government responsibilities. It helps to further deepen the reform of the system concerning matters subject to administrative review and approval, significantly reduce the range for government review and approval, innovate on methods of government supervision, promote investment and trade facilitation, and constantly improve administrative efficiency and effectiveness. It helps to urge the government to strengthen market regulation in line with the thought and approaches of the rule of law, make market regulation institutionalized, standardized and procedure-based, and fundamentally promote the transformation of government functions. 
4. Implementing the negative list system for market access is a requisite measure to build a new system for an open economy.
Implementing the negative list system for market access and foreign investment is an effective way to promote reform through opening up and construct a higher-level market economy. It helps to speed up the establishment of a modern market system in line with the prevailing international rules and create a business environment based on the rule of law. By stimulating the orderly and free flow of international and domestic factors of production, highly efficient allocation of resources and in-depth market integration, it will constantly make our country more internationally competitive. 
II. General requirements and applicable conditions

5. General requirements.
Upholding the direction of reform towards the socialist market economy, we will ensure that the market plays a decisive role in the allocation of resources while better playing the role of the government, transform government functions while exercising government administration in an innovative way, and stimulate the market’s vitality while strengthening market regulation. We will relax and regulate market access, simplify and optimize administrative review and approval, strengthen and innovate on market regulation, and speed up establishing a new system to regulate market access, in which the market is open, fair, standardized and orderly, enterprises enjoy independent decision-making and fair competition, and the government makes clear its power and responsibilities and enforces strong supervision. 
All regions and departments should earnestly put in place the negative list system for market access. For the investment and business operations made by all kinds of market players on a voluntary basis, once there are areas or procedures concerning market access, the negative list system should be established and implemented; when conditions are mature, the current directory-based items about market access will be incorporated into the negative list for market access. 
6.Categories.
A negative list for market access includes two categories: “prohibited” and “restricted” items. It applies to the investment and business operations made by all kinds of market players on a voluntary basis, including initial investment, expansion investment, mergers and acquisitions as well as other market entry. For prohibited items, market players have no access to them and administrative bodies are not allowed to give review and approval or handle relevant formalities. For restricted items, market players may file an application and administrative bodies make the decision according to the law whether they are given access; or market players may enter these areas in accordance with government regulations on access conditions and methods. All kinds of market players may enter sectors, areas and businesses not on the negative list on an equal basis and according to the law.
7. licable conditions.
If all kinds of market players are involved in investment, business operations and other market entry in the following areas, we can, according to laws, administrative regulations and the relevant provisions of the State Council decisions, adopt management measures to prohibit access or restrict market players’ qualifications, equity ratio, business scope, operation formats, business models, spatial layout, and national land spatial development and protection: 
Relevant sectors, areas and businesses concerning national security such as the safety of people’s life and property, political security, homeland security, military security, economic security, financial security, cultural security, social security, science and technology security, information security, ecological security, resource security, nuclear security and security in emerging fields; 
Relevant sectors, areas and businesses concerning distribution of the major national productive forces, strategic resources development and major public interests; 
Relevant sectors, areas and businesses which concern investment and business operations of market players and where the procedure for administrative permission may be instituted by the law; 
Other circumstances stipulated by the law, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions. 
8. Main types and applicable objects of negative lists.
Negative lists mainly include a negative list for market access and a negative list for foreign investment. A negative list for market access, which applies to domestic and overseas investors with consistent management measures, is the unified requirement for market access of all kinds of market players; a negative list for foreign investment, which applies to overseas investors’ investment and business operations in China, is the special management measure for foreign investment entry. While drawing up a negative list for foreign investment, we should give an overall consideration to negotiations over foreign investment issues. Relevant matters shall be formulated separately. Where there are other provisions in the bilateral or multilateral agreements signed by China, the provisions of those agreements shall prevail. 
III. Procedures of drawing up, implementing and adjusting a negative list for market access

9. Principles of drawing up a negative list.
The principle of the rule of law. While drawing up a negative list for market access, we should fully implement the basic strategy of the rule of law in governance. New items, which are not covered by the law, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions but indeed need to be incorporated into a negative list for market access, should be submitted for formulation in accordance with legal procedures based on scientific evaluations; or in another way, laws, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions should be revised. Significant items concerning the national economic and social development and those with the high degree of specialization should go through decision-making procedures including public participation, expert argumentation, risk assessment, legality review and collective deliberation. 
The principle of security. While drawing up and implementing a negative list for market access, we should maintain a holistic view of national security and follow laws and regulations safeguarding national security as well as the national systems concerning security in various fields. With a focus on safeguarding economic security, we should maintain the national basic economic system and the socialist market economic order, improve the institutional mechanism to prevent and dissolve the economic security risks, guarantee key sectors and areas that are the lifeblood of the economy, key industries, major infrastructure and major construction projects, and ensure the security of other significant economic benefits. 
The principle of progression. While drawing up and implementing a negative list for market access, we should proceed from our national conditions in a gradual and orderly way, have an overall planning and implement it step by step. Full implementation is allowed only after the experience gained is replicable and widely applicable. As for new technologies, products, operation formats and business models emerging in the market, we should, based on the principle of encouraging innovation and lowering the threshold to entrepreneurship, strengthen institutional supply, integrate supervision with service and not rush to incorporate them into a negative list for market access.
The principle of necessity. Items included in a negative list for market access should be simplified as much as possible and should be indeed necessary. Those items prohibited or restricted by laws, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions cannot be simply incorporated into a negative list for market access. The sectors, areas and businesses where investment and business operations are currently prohibited or restricted for market players cannot be simply copied into a negative list for market access. The items independent of market access and the post-access supervision measures cannot be confused with the management measures for market access. Such measures as registration, information collection and examination and approval for land use, which are generally imposed on market players, cannot be incorporated into a negative list for market access. licable conditions for a negative list for market access cannot be mechanically applied and the items which are not suitable for the negative list management cannot be incorporated into it. 
The principle of openness. A negative list for market access should be drawn up and adjusted on an open, fair and just footing, thus forming stable, transparent and predictable institutional arrangements and guaranteeing the rights of the general public to be informed and to participate. The items concerned, the basis for and the results of drawing up and adjusting a negative list for market access shall be made public for consultation, except for those that shall be kept confidential according to the law.
10. Procedures of drawing up a negative list.
A negative list for market access is drawn up and released by the State Council; any adjustments required by local governments should be submitted to the State Council for approval by provincial-level governments. All departments and units responsible for market access management should make an overall review on the sectors, areas and businesses where investment and business operations are prohibited or restricted for market players. They should propose their own draft negative lists for market access according to unified classification standards in the Classification of National Economic Industries. (Those applying to various categories in the Classification of National Economic Industries and new operation formats not listed in the Classification of National Economic Industries should be specified otherwise.) The National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce shall take the lead to summarize and review them, form a unified negative list for market access, and submit it to the State Council for approval before implementation. 
The management measures for market access, proposed according to laws, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions, should go through legality examination. Their rationality, feasibility and controllability should be assessed according to the requirement for the market to play a decisive role in the allocation of resources. As for those management measures for market access, which are put forward according to department rules and regulatory documents and indeed need to be incorporated into a negative list for market access, we should formulate or revise laws and administrative regulations in accordance with legal procedures, or submit them to the State Council for the final decision after careful argumentation according to the procedures clearly identified in the Opinions. 
While drawing up a negative list for market access, we should take differences of regional development into full consideration and make it more practical and well-targeted. Based on a national unified negative list for market access, provincial-level governments are allowed to make suggestions to adjust it according to their own resource advantages, definition of major functional areas, comparative industrial advantages, production cooperation, the network of logistics marketing and eco-environmental impacts. It should be submitted to the State Council for approval before implementation. Without the authorization of the State Council, all regions and departments are not allowed to release a negative list for market access by themselves, and increase or decrease the items included in a negative list. 
While drawing up a negative list for market access, relevant departments should improve the decision-making mechanism which combines public participation, expert argumentation with government decision. They should fully listen to the opinions from all regions and departments, organize experts to assess its necessity and feasibility, and solicit opinions from the public. What is involved in national security should be reported to the National Security Commission of the CPC Central Committee for review in advance. 
11. Procedures of implementing a negative list.
Based on the principle of trial implementation before gradual popularization, we will try out the negative list system for market access in some regions from December 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. By accumulating experience and making gradual improvements, we will explore to form a national unified negative list for market access and establish a corresponding system and mechanism. The national unified negative list system for market access will be officially implemented from the year 2018 on. The National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce shall take the lead to propose a draft negative list for market access and identify the pilot regions, submit them to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council for approval and then organize these regions to carry out the pilot work. The provincial-level governments in these pilot regions should, on the basis of the draft negative list for market access, put forward a plan for trying out the negative list system, and submit it to the State Council for approval before implementation. Where the implementation of the relevant laws, administrative regulations and their relevant provisions are suspended, it should be handled in accordance with legal procedures.
According to the requirements of The Work Plan for Carrying out the Pilot Reform of the Negative List System for Market Access (See Annex), the provincial-level governments in the pilot regions should strengthen organizational leadership and overall coordination, improve the working mechanism including process management, warning and forecasting, information feedback and dynamic performance evaluation, and ensure substantive progress on the reform. Relevant departments should enhance coordination with the pilot regions and try out the reform measures to optimize the market access management there. Departments including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce should strengthen guidance, supervision and inspection, discover and solve various problems in the process of the reform timely, and report significant matters to the State Council without delay. 
12. Procedures of adjusting a negative list.
Based on the principle of streamlining administration and delegating government power, easing restrictions and strengthening regulation where necessary, and improving services, a negative list for market access should be adjusted timely after implementation according to the overall progress of the reform, economic restructuring as well as revised laws and regulations. With the authorization of the State Council, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce should take the lead to establish an inter-departmental deliberation and coordination mechanism, take charge of the daily work of implementing the negative list system for market access and carry out third-party evaluations. Adjusting significant items therein and increasing management measures for market access should be reported to the State Council for approval. While adjusting management measures for market access according to laws, administrative regulations and the relevant provisions of the State Council decisions, or adjusting non-essential contents such as technical and declarative contents, or decreasing management measures for market access, relevant departments should make suggestions for adjustment and submit them to the State Council for the record after review of the deliberation and coordination mechanism. What is involved in national security should be reported to the National Security Commission of the CPC Central Committee for review in advance.
IV. Methods of identification and the alignment with current systems

13. The negative list for market access should be well aligned with the list of items for administrative review and approval.
While drawing up a negative list for market access, we should align it with the list of items for administrative review and approval. The restrictive measures about the sectors, areas and businesses which market players have access to during their investment and business operations should in principle be incorporated into the negative list for market access. Those items concerning market access, which are free from administrative review and approval and not included in the List of Items for Administrative Review and roval by all Departments of the State Council, should not be incorporated into the negative list for market access. Other items which are qualified for the negative list after review should be itemized in it. In the future, while the State Council decides to annul, increase or adjust items subject to administrative review and approval, the negative list for market access should be directly aligned with the revised list of items for administrative review and approval.
14. The negative list for market access should be well aligned with the Guiding Catalog for Industrial Restructuring. 
The eliminative and restrictive project categories in the Guiding Catalog for Industrial Restructuring should not be itemized again but directly referenced in the access-prohibited list, according to the State Council decisions on Releasing and Implementing “Interim Regulations on Promoting Industrial Restructuring,” (State Council Doc. No. 40 [2005]) which says “investment is banned in the eliminative category of projects” and “investment is banned in the restrictive category of projects.” Relevant departments should adapt to industrial restructuring and the new situation that ever-changing new products and technologies emerge in an endless stream, and revise the Guiding Catalog for Industrial Restructuring in a timely manner. In the future, while revisions are made in the Guiding Catalog for Industrial Restructuring, the negative list for market access should be directly aligned with its revised version.
15. The negative list for market access should be well aligned with the List of Investment Projects Requiring Government Review and roval.
The projects subject to government review and approval in the List of Investment Projects Requiring Government Review and roval (foreign-invested projects and overseas investment projects not included but elsewhere specified) should not be itemized again but directly referenced in the access-restricted list. According to the overall plan for comprehensively deepening reform, relevant departments should speed up studying and formulating a decision on deepening reform of the investment and financing system as well as the regulations on investment projects subject to government review and approval and archival filing, and adjust the List of Investment Projects Requiring Government Review and roval timely. In the future, while the State Council decides to revise the List of Investment Projects Requiring Government Review and roval, the negative list for market access should be directly aligned with its revised version. 
16. The negative list for market access should be well aligned with the management items for market access proposed according to the laws, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions.
The management measures for market access, proposed according to laws, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions, should be classified into the access-prohibited list and the access-restricted list after review. Relevant departments should make timely and corresponding adjustments for the negative list for market access according to revisions of laws and administrative regulations as well as the clean-up of the State Council documents. The items, which are not clearly prescribed as preconditions by laws, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions, shall no longer go through preliminary review and approval procedures; the items, which are clearly prescribed as preconditions by laws, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions, shall no longer go through preliminary review and approval procedures by revising the laws, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions, except that there is a need to keep it in that way. 
V. Safeguards

17. Establishing and improving the access mechanism to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access.
All kinds of market players may enter sectors, areas and businesses not on the negative list on an equal basis and according to the law, and no longer require government approval. Power should be delegated to enterprises to the necessary extent and market players can decide by themselves items beyond the negative list according to the law. Following the principle of easing restrictions and strengthening regulation where necessary, relevant departments should give an overall consideration to factors such as national security, ecological environment, interests of the people and workplace safety, improve the indicator system for comprehensive evaluation, ensure enterprises to bear the primary responsibility, strengthen supervision according to the law, establish an accountability mechanism for safety review and supervision, and form a new pattern featured with government supervision, enterprise autonomy, industry self-regulation and social supervision. For the items on the negative list for market access, taking different instances into account, relevant departments may explore the means of making a pre-access pledge and further enhance the implementation of other supporting measures such as conducting informative recordation and disclosing information about access. By making a pre-access pledge, we mean that all kinds of market players are allowed to have access after promising to fulfill their legal obligations, undertake social responsibilities and practice social integrity, and submitting a letter of commitment to relevant departments. By conducting informative recordation, we mean that all kinds of market players should immediately fulfill their obligations to conduct informative recordation with relevant departments if their investment and business operations have been carried out. By disclosing information about access, we mean that all kinds of market players should fulfill their obligations stipulated in the Provisional Regulations on Enterprise Information Disclosure according to the law. 
18. Improving the review and approval mechanism to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access.
For items with restricted access, governments at all levels and relevant departments should, based on their review and approval power, regulate their rights and obligations and the standards of review and approval. According to the requirements of The Notice of the State Council on Regulating Administrative Review and roval by State Council Departments and Improving the Work Related to Administrative Review and roval (State Council Doc. No. 6 [2015]), and the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Issuing the Work Plan for Reducing the Number of Items Requiring Government Review and roval, Regulating Intermediary Services for Investment Projects, and Reviewing and roving Enterprises’ Investment Projects Online (General Office of the State Council Doc. No. 59 [2014]), they should streamline preliminary review and approval procedures, optimize and regulate review and approval procedures, and make them open and transparent with clear power and responsibilities. Preliminary review and approval of the items concerning national security and workplace safety should be regulated and strengthened in accordance with the law. All regions are encouraged to put forward a list of items requiring administrative review and approval prior to market access (the “restricted” category) at provincial-, municipal- and county-level governments, and make clear the names of the items requiring review and approval, the reasons for such requirements, the scope of application, the subject of implementation, handling requirements, the checklist and requirements for application, handling procedures and time limit. We should speed up establishing a “unified, standardized, efficient, convenient, open and transparent” online platform for joint review, approval and supervision, which is featured with “parallel operation, information sharing and full supervision,” and ensure all the items requiring review and approval are “made clear, handled, completed and supervised online.” 
19. Establishing and improving the supervision mechanism to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access.
According to the principle of each fulfilling their respective responsibilities and law-based regulation, all regions and departments should strengthen supervision both during and after investment and business operations of market players. Based on the principle of streamlining administration and delegating government power, law-based regulation, fairness and transparency, the integration of power and responsibility, the joint governance of the government, market and society, we need to improve the regulation approach, innovate on the regulation pattern, promote regulation efficiency, optimize the supervision of post-access market behaviors, and ensure the items not on the negative list of market access are well regulated. Relevant departments should enhance the formulation, adjustment and management of the development strategy, the development plan, industrial policies and the standard specification, set a “red line” strictly according to the law, and strengthen the ongoing and ex-post regulation. All regions are encouraged to put forward a list for supervision in provincial-, municipal- and county-level governments, make clear the items subject to supervision, the reasons for such requirements, the subject of supervision, its authority, the contents, methods and procedures of supervision as well as punitive measures, and construct a supervision pattern with legal restraint, administrative supervision, industry regulation, public participation and enterprise integrity and self-discipline well integrated. We need to push industry associations and chambers of commerce to establish and improve the industry self-discipline norm, the self-disciplinary convention and the code of professional ethics. We need to establish and improve an industry self-discipline mechanism to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access. 
20. Establishing and improving the social credit-rating system and the credit-related incentive and punishment mechanism to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access.
We should improve the social credit-rating system and the enterprise credit information disclosure system. Market players’ credit information should be included into the website http://www.creditchina.gov.cn and shared on the national credit information sharing platform. The aim is to offer the public important information concerning various market players, when they are involved in production, investment, distribution, consumption and other economic activities. We should also promote the establishment of a mechanism, under which market players must make a pledge before entering the market, promising that they will willingly accept punishment and restrictions if they commit any law-breaking or dishonest acts, and this pledge will be included into their credit records. We should improve the credit-related incentive and punishment mechanism. Market players should be divided into groups and treated differently according to their credit records, and the grouping and treatment should be changed when there are changes in their credit records. Support and incentive will be granted to honest market players, while restrictions on investment, land supply, bidding, allocation of budgetary funds and other issues will be placed on dishonest ones in accordance with the law. Market players should be blacklisted if they seriously breach competition norms, disturb market order, or infringe upon the legitimate rights of consumers, workers and other business operators. If the case is extremely serious, the guilty market player should be prohibited from entering the market in accordance with the law. 
21. Establishing and improving the information disclosure and sharing systems to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access.
On the basis of the enterprise credit information disclosure system, we should improve various other systems, such as the system of regularly releasing enterprises’ annual reports and their latest news, the system of checking disclosed information on a random basis, and the system of listing enterprises with abnormal practices or serious law-breaking behaviors. Information on enterprises’ production and operation, as well as government information that can reflect enterprises’ conditions, should be disclosed timely as stipulated in the Provisional Regulations on Enterprise Information Disclosure and other relevant regulations. Restrictions should be placed on enterprises that fail to disclose their information on time, conceal facts, or fiddle figures. These companies should be restricted or prohibited from participating in events such as government procurement, project bidding and sales of state-owned land-use rights. All regions and departments should follow the central government’s rules, promote the building of local credit information platforms for enterprises under their administration or in their own fields, and make the information available to the public on the national credit information sharing platform.
22. Improving laws and regulations to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access. 
While implementing the negative list system for market access, we should put equal attention to the revision of current laws and the promulgation of new laws. Relevant departments should sort out laws, regulations, rules, normative documents and administrative approval procedures concerning market access, investment and business operations in accordance with the law and prescribed procedures. For those that need to be revised or abolished, concerning departments should make proposals accordingly. For items beyond the negative list, articles concerning them should be abolished or revised immediately. If the revision or abolishment contradicts current laws, the State Council should propose the revision or suspension of the law to the National People’s Congress or its standing committee, and make it known to the public. If the revision or abolishment contradicts current administrative regulations, the State Council should revise or suspend the regulation, and make it known to the public. Besides, we should accelerate the promulgation of new laws to meet the requirement of the negative list system, thus to provide legal grounds for government departments to perform their functions and powers concerning market access, and exercise supervision during and after projects.
VI. Accelerating the reform and establishment of relevant systems 

23. Establishing an investment system to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access.
All enterprises’ investment projects, except for those concerning national security, ecological security, distribution of the major national productive forces, strategic resources development and major public interests, should be decided by the enterprises independently in accordance with the law, and no longer require government approval. Following the State Council’s guidelines, the National Development and Reform Commission should reform the review and approval system for investment projects, timely revise and release the List of Investment Projects Requiring Government Review and roval in accordance with prescribed procedures, narrow down the scope of investment projects subject to government review and approval, and review and approve enterprises’ investment projects online. We should enhance the coordination and supervision of government departments concerning economic planning, land and resources, environmental protection, technology and work safety, and control market access by setting criteria for environmental protection, energy saving, technology, work safety and other issues. When foreign-invested companies make investments in fixed-asset projects, they should enjoy national treatment and follow the review and record keeping procedures applied to domestic enterprises. 
24. Establishing a business registration system to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access.
We will deepen the reform of the business system, accelerate the implementation of “three licenses in one” and “one code for one license,” and roll out a unified system of codes for rating the credit of legal persons and other organizations. We will simplify preliminary review and approval procedures, and reduce the number of items that require qualification verification. All the investment and business operations made by market players on a voluntary basis should not be denied access except that the areas are banned and limited by laws, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions. We will sort out current administrative measures concerning market access and cancel those that are not supported by laws, administrative regulations and the State Council decisions. 
25. Establishing a management system for foreign investment to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access.
Relevant departments should step up efforts to formulate a negative list for foreign investment according to the management model of pre-establishment national treatment and negative list. In line with the requirements of simplification and convenience, we should gradually streamline the licensing procedures for foreign investment areas, explore and implement one-stop review and approval and reduce licensing procedures. According to the need for safeguarding national security, we should make more efforts to improve the system for security reviews of foreign investment. Any foreign investment concerning national security should be subject to security reviews under the national security review system and relevant regulations. We should strengthen the ongoing and ex-post regulation, establish an information reporting mechanism for foreign investment and an information publishing system for foreign investment, and put in place a monitoring system for foreign investment in which governments share information and coordinate inspection and the public plays a part in monitoring. 
26. Fostering the market environment for fair trade and competition to meet the requirement of the negative list system for market access.
Relevant departments should review and cancel all kinds of regulations and practices that restrain the market from playing a decisive role in the allocation of resources and impede the national unified market and fair competition, strictly ban and publish all unlawful acts extending preferential policies, combat local protection, oppose monopoly and unfair competition, and prevent relevant policies from impeding the national integral market and fair competition. We will improve the systems and mechanisms that define, operate and protect property rights, liquidity rights, equities and intellectual rights according to the law. We will persist in equality of rights, opportunities and rules, abolish all forms of irrational regulations for the non-public economy, remove all hidden barriers, and adopt specific measures for market players to enter natural monopoly and franchising fields according to the law. 　　
In order to enhance the system of national governance and the modernization of governance capability, all regions and departments should fully recognize the importance and urgency of carrying out the negative list system for market access, do their work well in the formulation and implementation of the negative list system for market access, speed up relevant reforms and the establishment of matching schemes, timely spot and solve budding, tendentious and potential problems, and ensure that the reform achieves results.

			State Council plans trials for balance sheet of natural resources






Updated:
Nov 17,2015 10:57 AM
	    english.gov.cn












The central government is drafting trial plans for implementing the balance sheet of natural resources, which is expected to provide surveillance and warnings to policy-makers regarding environment protection, according to a document released by the State Council General Office on Nov 17. 
As part of the government’s efforts to create an ecological civilization, the balance sheet will connect with important policies such as the management of “redline areas”, property rights and use of natural resource assets, and the accountability system for ecological damage. 
The State Council also urged establishing a data monitoring system for natural resources using modern technology and legal approaches to improve statistical accuracy. 
The balance sheet will also refer to international standards such as the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting, released by the United Nations and other organizations. 
The accounting of natural resources will start with important ecological functions, which include land, forestation and water. 
The trial of the balance sheet will take place from November 2015 to the end of 2016 in Hulunbuir of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Huzhou of Zhejiang province, Loudi of Hunan province, Chishui of Guizhou province, and Yan’an of Shaanxi province. 
Based on trial results and further research, the National Bureau of Statistics, along with other government departments, will seek to expand the accounting scope for natural resources. The official and final version of the balance sheet is expected to be launched by the end of 2018.

			State Council to streamline intermediary services






Updated:
Oct 15,2015 4:33 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued a circular on Oct 15 regarding the decision to cancel and regulate 89 intermediary services that will no longer be required as preliminary conditions for administrative approval by government departments.
The move, which will improve regulations and standards of intermediary services as well as the quality and efficiency of administrative approvals, is being made by the State Council to further transform government functions and deepen reform of the administrative approval system.
According to the circular, some intermediary services have been canceled as applicants will no longer be required to provide the review, assessment or certification that used to be issued by intermediary service institutions officially designated by government departments.
For example, applicants will no longer be required to submit an asset audit report by accounting or audit firms to the Ministry of Education in order to establish private colleges or universities.
Some intermediary services will be regulated, as government departments will commission related institutions to provide technical services.
For example, pharmaceutical manufacturers will no longer be required to provide quality tests for pesticides, which have enterprise standards but no national and industry standards, to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which will commission related institutions to do the test.
In some areas, applicants are still required to provide government departments with technical reviews or assessments. But they will not have to go to intermediary service institutions designated by government departments. Instead, applicants can make their own reports or commission them to related institutions.
The State Council required government departments to carry out solid implementation of streamlining intermediary services, improving administrative management and creating a fairer market environment.

			State Council approves plan for industrial park in Suzhou






Updated:
Oct 13,2015 3:30 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has approved a plan submitted by the Jiangsu provincial government and the Ministry of Commerce of a pilot program in the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park, an industrial cluster in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, to make the park more open and more innovative.
The State Council asked that the park draw on experiences from the country’s free trade zones and upgrade its industries and competitiveness.
According to the plan, the pilot program is expected to turn the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park into a world-class high-tech industrial cluster and enhance international cooperation.
Among other tasks the plan has set out, the park should bring in high-end industries, encourage companies to work on research and development and marketing, and attract multinational companies to locate their high-end factories inside the park.
Also, the plan encourages domestic companies to purchase advanced techniques and equipment, and encourages those who have their own patented technologies to join multinational companies to make their products. 
In the meantime, the industrial park should invest more in information technology and make its industries smarter, and should encourage medium and small enterprises as well as research institutes and professionals returning from abroad to start up businesses and engage in innovation.
The park should focus on developing the biopharmaceutical industry, the application of nanotechnology and cloud computing and set a leading example in the country of boosting innovation through international cooperation. 
The plan asks related authorities to continue to streamline administrative approval procedures concerning the development of the park and improve oversight of the park, in order to help make it grow at a faster pace.
It also asks the park to be developed in a way that is environmentally friendly and energy-efficient.

	    english.gov.cn












The State Council on Sept 16 approved the overall city plan for Yantai in East China’s Shandong province, urging local government to build a “modern city of economic prosperity and social harmony”. 
As a central city and important port on the Shandong Peninsula, Yantai will pursue integrated development and management of urban and rural areas in the next five years. 
Covering 3,002 square kilometers of a planned zone, the city will enhance infrastructure and public facilities that will better serve peripheral villages and further connect with neighboring cities such as Qingdao and Weihai. 
The layout of public service facilities, such as education, medical care and municipal administration, is expected to be further optimized to ensure equality between urban and rural citizens. The urban transportation system and disaster prevention system are also likely to be improved. 
According to the plan, Yantai’s permanent residents will be kept below 2.3 million until 2020, while the area of land for urban development will not be allowed to exceed 255 square kilometers. The city should raise the efficiency of land use and safeguard the farmlands. 
The State Council also called on Yantai to eliminate outdated production facilities to build a resource-conserving and environment-friendly city. 
In addition, the city will also enhance its capabilities on waste treatment and take measures to protect historic sites, as well as some special ecological functional zones, such as Ya Mountain in Qixia county.

			Full Text: Integrated Reform Plan for Promoting Ecological Progress 






Updated:
Sep 22,2015 8:43 AM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council, or China’s cabinet, on Sept 21 published a reform plan for promoting ecological progress in the country. Following is the full text:

INTEGRATED REFORM PLAN FOR PROMOTING ECOLOGICAL PROGRESS
This plan has been formulated for putting systematic and complete systems for improving the ecosystem in place more quickly; achieving faster ecological progress; and making the reform for promoting ecological progress more systemic, more holistic, and better coordinated.
I. A General Description
1. The thinking behind the reform
It is crucial to fully implement the guiding principles from the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the second, third, and fourth plenary sessions of the 18th CPC Central Committee; follow the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development; thoroughly put into practice the guiding principles from the major speeches of General Secretary Xi Jinping; act in accordance with the decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council; adhere to the fundamental state policy of conserving resources and protecting the environment; and give high priority to resource conservation, environmental protection, and the restoration of nature. Based on the fundamental context of China being in the primary stage of socialism and in the particular characteristics new to China in the present phase,and in order to build a beautiful China, handle correctly the relationship between humankind and nature, and solve serious ecological and environmental problems,it is essential to safeguard China’s ecological security, improve the environment, ensure that resources are used more efficiently, and step up efforts to promote the formation of a new pattern of modernization in which humankind develops in harmony with nature.
2. The ideas
The idea is to:
Respect, protect, and stay in tune with nature.Ecological conservation is vital not only to sustained, healthy economic development, but also to political and social progress, and must therefore be given a position of prominence and incorporated into every aspect and the whole process of economic, political, cultural, and social development.
Integrate development and conservation. It is necessary to remain committed to the strategy of treating development as being of the utmost importance to China. Development is good only when it is green, circular, and low-carbon. There should be the right balance between development and conservation.The intensity of development should be brought under control on the basis of functional zoning and spatial planning should be adjusted to ensure that development and conservation are coordinated and reinforce each other so we leave behind a comfortable place that future generations can call home with blue skies, green lands, and clear waters.
Foster an understanding that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets. Fresh air, clean water sources, beautiful rivers and mountains, fertile land, and biological diversity form an ecological environment that is essential to human survival. As development is a top priority for China, it is imperative to protect forests, grasslands, rivers, lakes, wetlands, seas, and other natural ecosystems.
Cultivate respect for the value of nature and natural capital. Natural ecosystems have value; the protection of nature is a process of increasing the value of nature and the value of natural capital, and means the protection and development of the productive forces. Protection efforts should, then, be adequately rewarded and come with economic returns.
Seek equilibriums in China’s territorial space. To move forward with development, it is necessary to find the right balance between population, economy, resources, and the environment and ensure that the population, the industrial structure, and the economic growth of a region do not surpass its environmental capacity and the carrying capacity of its water and land resources.
See that mountains, waters, forests, and farmlands are a community of life. Based on the integrity and systemic nature of ecosystems and the way they work, it is necessary to take into consideration all the elements of the natural ecosystem - both hills and their surrounding areas, both above and under the ground, both land and sea, both upper and lower river basins -and work to protect them in their entirety, restore them systematically, and take a comprehensive approach to their governance in order to preserve ecological balance by strengthening the ability of ecosystems to circulate. 
3. The principles
Ensuring that the reform moves in the right direction. China’s market mechanisms need to be improved, and the government should make better use of its leadership and regulatory roles. Those in the business sector should bring their own initiative into play and exercise self-restraint. Social organizations and the general public should participate and play a supervising role in ecological conservation.
Maintaining the public nature of natural resource assets. New property rights systems should be created for natural resources. Ownership rights should be clarified. There should be a distinction between ownership rights and the authority to manage. Powers and regulatory responsibilities of the central and local governments should be divided more appropriately. Everyone should be entitled to benefit from state-owned natural resource assets.
Integrating environmental governance for rural and urban areas. Continued efforts should be made to strengthen urban environmental protection and industrial pollution prevention and control. The rural coverage of ecological and environmental protection efforts should be expanded. Effective systems and mechanisms for rural environmental governance should be established. The development of pollution prevention and control facilities should be stepped up in rural areas, and related funding should be increased.
Attaching equal importance to incentives and restraints. It is imperative to develop interest-related mechanisms for promoting green, circular, and low-carbon development, and at the same time practice strict prevention at the source of pollution, strict regulation over operations, strict compensation for environmental damage, and accountability for those responsible in order to effectively restrain all types of market entities and, step by step, make ecological conservation efforts more market-, law-, and procedure-based.
Combining China’s own independent efforts with international cooperation. Strengthening ecological conservation and environmental protection is something China is doing of its own accord, though at the same time it needs to deepen exchange and practical cooperation with other countries, borrow from their advanced technology and their valuable experience in institution building, take an active part in global environmental governance, and assume and perform its international responsibilities as a large developing country.
Integrating piloting first with overall coordination. It is necessary, in accordance with the unified plans of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, to deal with the easier parts first, move forward step by step, and launch each reform when conditions are ripe to do so. On the basis of the fundamental direction laid out in this plan, encouragement should be given to local governments to explore and experiment boldly in light of their own local conditions.
4. The objectives
This reform is designed to establish a systematic and complete institutional framework composed of eight systems for promoting ecological progress with clearly defined property rights, diversified participation, and equal focus on incentives and restraints by 2020. It is also designed to modernize China’s governance system and capacity for governance in the field of ecological progress and usher in a new era for socialist ecological progress. These eight systems include a system of property rights for natural resource assets, a system for the development and protection of territorial space, a spatial planning system, a system for regulating total consumption and comprehensive conservation of resources, a system for payment-based resource consumption and compensating conservation and protection efforts, the environmental governance system, the market system for environmental governance and ecological preservation, and the system for evaluating officials’ ecological conservation performance and for holding those responsible for ecological damage to account.
A system of property rights for natural resource assets will be established, according to which ownership is clearly defined, powers and responsibilities are explicit, and regulation is effective, in order to ensure there are owners for natural resources and ownership is clear.
A system will be built on the basis of spatial planning for the development and protection of territorial space, drawing on regulation of its uses as the main approach, with a view to stopping the over-use of quality cropland and ecological space, ecological damage, and environmental pollution caused by disorderly, excessive, and scattered development. 
A spatial planning system will be designed, with the main purpose of strengthening the spatial governance and improving its structure, which is nationally unified and better connected between different departments of government, and according to which management is divided between governments at multiple levels, in an effort to eliminate overlapping and conflicting spatial plans, the overlap and duplication of responsibilities between departments, and the issue of local authorities frequently changing their plans.
An effective, standardized,and strictly managed system that achieves complete coverage will be established for regulating total consumption and comprehensive conservation of resources, in order to address inefficiency and serious waste in resource consumption.
A system for payment-based resource consumption and compensating conservation and protection efforts will be established. The system will reflect market supply and demand, resource scarcity, the value of nature, and the need for intergenerational compensation, in order to address the problems of excessively low prices for natural resources and their products, the cost of production and development being lower than the social cost, and inadequate incentives for ecological conservation efforts.
An environmental governance system which is oriented toward improving the environment, and which incorporates unified regulation, strict law enforcement, and multi-party participation will be developed in an effort to deal with weak capacity for pollution prevention and control, overlapping regulatory functions between government departments, powers not being in accord with responsibilities, and the cost of law violations being too low.
A market system which allows economic levers to play a greater role in environmental governance and ecological conservation will be developed, with a view to addressing the slow development of market entities and market systems and low rates of public participation in ecological conservation.
An evaluation and accountability system will be developed to assess the performance of officials in ecological conservation and hold to account those responsible for ecological damage. This system will be designed to be fully reflective of resource consumption, environmental damage, and ecological benefits, and is to be built so as to correct the shortcomings in performance evaluations, narrow the gaps in responsibility systems, and improve poor accountability for ecological damage.

II. Improving the System of Property Rights for Natural Resource Assets
5. Establishing a unified system for determining and registering ownership
The owners of natural resource assets of all types throughout all Chinese territorial space will be determined in accordance with the principles that all natural resources in China are publicly owned and all property rights are legally prescribed. Ownership of all natural ecological spaces including water flows, forests, mountains, grasslands, uncultivated land, and tidal flats will, according to a unified system, be determined and registered. Clear lines will be gradually delineated to distinguish between assets owned by the whole people and assets collectively owned,ownership by the whole people and ownership operated by different levels of government, and between different collective owners. The rule of law will be strengthened in the determination and registration of ownership.
6. Establishing a system of property rights for natural resources within which rights and responsibilities are explicit
A list of rights will be developed to specify the rights of ownership for all types of natural resource assets. The relationship between ownership rights and use rights will be properly dealt with. New forms of collective ownership and ownership by the whole people will be created. With the exception of natural resources which are ecologically important, the ownership rights and use rights for all other natural resources can be separated. It will be made clear who has the right to possess, use, benefit from, or dispose of natural resources, and corresponding rights and responsibilities will be clarified. The right to sell, transfer, and rent out use rights, as well as the right to use them as collateral, as the basis of a loan guaranty, or to gain an equity stake, will all be suitably expanded. The roles of owners and users of land on which state-owned farms, forests, and pastures are located will be clearly defined. A complete system for sale will be established covering all types of natural resource assets owned by the whole people, while the uncompensated transfer of rights or their sale at excessively low a price are to be strictly forbidden. We will draw up an integrated plan for strengthening efforts to develop a natural resource asset exchange. 
7. Improving the state system of management for natural resource assets
In accordance with the principles of separating owners from regulators and assigning the responsibility for one matter to one single department, the currently diffuse duties and responsibilities of ownership of natural resource assets owned by the whole people will be integrated, and one body will be established to carry out the unified exercise of ownership rights for all types of natural resources owned by the whole people, such as mineral deposits, water flows, forests, mountains, grasslands, uncultivated land, marine areas, and tidal flats, and take responsibility for the sale of these natural resources.
8. Exploring the establishment of a system for exercising ownership rights at different levels
Research will be conducted to explore how a system can be put into practice in which, in accordance with the type of resource and its importance in relation to the ecological environment, the economy, and national defense, the central and local governments act as the agents of the owners of natural resource assets owned by the whole people, in order to achieve both efficiency and equity. Resources and territorial space for which the ownership rights are owned by the whole people and directly exercised by the Central Government will be distinguished from those for which the ownership rights are owned by the whole people and exercised by local governments. The Central Government will primarily exercise directly the ownership rights for petroleum and natural gas, valuable and rare mineral resources, key state-owned forests, major rivers and lakes, trans-boundary rivers, ecologically important wetlands and grasslands, marine areas, tidal flats, rare and endangered species of wild fauna and flora, and some national parks.
9. Launching trials for determining property rights for water flows and wetlands
Explorations will be made into establishing a water ownership system. Trials will be carried out in determining ownership of bodies of water, coast lines, and other aquatic ecospace. On the basis of respecting the systematic nature and integrity of water ecosystems, the ownership rights, use rights, and allowable volumes for water resource use will be delineated. Trials will be launched in Gansu, Ningxia, and other areas for determining the ownership of wetlands.

III. Establishing a System for the Development and Protection of Territorial Space
10. Improving the functional zoning system
National- and provincial-level planning of functional zones will be coordinated. Regional policies which are based on the functional zones will be improved. On the basis of the different functions- urban areas, primary production areas for agricultural products, or key ecosystem service areas - adjustments and improvements to policies regarding finance, industry, investment, population flow, land to be used for construction, resource development, and environmental protection will be stepped up.
11. Improving the regulatory system for the use of territorial space
The top-down land-use indices control system will be simplified and the method of allocating indices based on administrative district and baselines for land use will be adjusted. Development intensity indices will be broken down and assigned to the county-level administrative districts as binding quotas to control the total amount of land used for construction purposes. Land use regulation will be extended to all natural ecological spaces, ecological redlines will be defined and strictly observed, and arbitrary changes to land use will be strictly prohibited. Efforts will be made to protect against ecological redlines being crossed by unreasonable development and construction activities. The monitoring system for all territorial space will be improved and a longitudinal approach will be used to monitor changes within China’s territorial space. 
12. Establishing a national park system
The protection of important ecosystems will be strengthened to ensure their sustainable use. The system of departments independently setting up their own nature reserves, historical and scenic sites, cultural and natural heritage sites, geological parks, and forest parks will be reformed. These protected areas will be reorganized by function and the scope of national parks will be determined as appropriate. National parks will be under more stringent protection: with the exception of improvements to the facilities used by local people in their everyday lives and work and nature-based research, education, and tourism which do not harm ecosystems, other types of development and construction will be prohibited so as to protect the authenticity and integrity of the natural ecological environment and natural and cultural heritage. Guidance on national park trials will be strengthened, and on the basis of these trials, research will be carried out into designing an overall plan for establishing a national park system. A permanent mechanism will be created for the protection of rare and endangered species of wild plants and animals.
13. Improving the system for regulating natural resources
Duties and responsibilities related to regulation of use, which are currently spread among different departments, will be gradually concentrated within a single department. This department will then perform all use-related regulatory duties and responsibilities for all territorial spaces.

IV. Establishing a Planning System for Territorial Space
14. Formulating plans for territorial space
All types of current spatial plans formulated by different departments will be integrated into unified spatial plans, which will be all-encompassing. The new plans will be the guide for the development of the country’s territorial space, and the spatial blueprints for sustainable development; they will be the fundamental basis for all types of development and construction programs. Spatial plans will be divided into national, provincial, and municipal (or county) levels (spatial plans for cities which are divided into districts will be formulated for the district level). Research will be conducted into how to establish unified and standardized mechanisms for formulating spatial plans. An environmental impact assessment system will be set up to be used in spatial planning. Provincial-level spatial planning trials are encouraged. A spatial plan will be developed for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.
15. Integrating municipal-level (county-level) plans
Cities and counties will be supported in combining different types of plans into a single spatial plan, such that gradually, there will be one plan - one blueprint - per city or county. Municipal or county spatial plans should classify land using a unified standard, and, in accordance with the relevant functional zoning and the requirements of the provincial-level spatial plan, should delineate production space, living space, and ecological space, demarcate the development boundaries of urban construction areas, industrial areas, and rural living areas, as well as the boundaries of protected areas of arable land, woodlands, grasslands, rivers, lakes, and wetlands, and strengthen coordinated planning for urban subsurface space. More effective guidance will be given to cities and counties regarding their trials for plan integration. Research will be undertaken into developing guidelines and technical standards for the formulation of municipal-level (county-level) spatial plans, which will then serve as experience that can be applied elsewhere. 
16. Developing new approaches for formulating municipal-level (county-level) spatial plans
We will explore how best to standardize procedures for formulating municipal-level (county-level)spatial plans, public participation will be expanded, and planning will be made more effective and transparent. Those areas piloting municipal-level (county-level) spatial plans are encouraged to integrate planning departments, making a single department responsible for formulating the spatial plan for that municipality or county; and they may form a planning appraisal committee of experts and representatives of the relevant fields. Prior to the formulation of a plan, a resource and environmental carrying capacity assessment must be carried out, and the results of the assessment should serve as the fundamental basis of planning. During the process of formulation, efforts should be made to solicit opinions of those from relevant sectors; the draft of the plan should be published in full so that the suggestions and comments of local residents can be extensively solicited. After evaluation and approval by the planning appraisal committee, the plan must be deliberated and passed by the local people’s congress, then reported to the relevant government department at the next level up to be placed on record. The finalized plan should include the text of the plan along with precise maps and images, and should be made available to the public through websites and other forms of local news media. Local residents are to be encouraged to oversee the implementation of the plan and report any development and construction activities that violate it. The local people’s congress and its standing committee will hear reports at regular intervals on the implementation of the plan, and will hold the local government accountable for violations of the plan.

V. Improving the Systems for Total Resource Management and Comprehensive Resource Conservation
17. Improving the systems for providing the strictest possible protection for farmland and securing the economical and intensive use of land
The system for the protection of basic cropland will be improved and a redline below which the area of China’ s permanent basic cropland must not fall will be established. To ensure that the area of basic cropland are not diminished, its quality does not deteriorate, and it is not converted to any other uses, the duty of basic cropland protection will be assigned to farming households and every piece of this cropland will be captured through photo-imaging and entered into the national cropland protection database, and its strict protection will be enforced. With the exception of unavoidable cases as specified by law in which basic cropland has to be used as the site of key national projects, no basic cropland may be used for construction purposes. Efforts will be redoubled to grade and monitor as well as maintain and improve the quality of cultivated land. The system for offsetting the occupation of cultivated land for purposes other than cultivation will be improved. A cap will be set on total cultivated land that can be used for new construction projects. It will be made sure that equivalent land is offset ahead of occupation and that the replacement land is of equal or higher grade than the cultivated land to be occupied. A cap will also be on total land that can be occupied for construction purposes, management will be instituted to reduce the amount of cultivatable land that is used as such, and incentive and constraint mechanisms will be established to encourage more economical and intensive use of land. Reasonable annual plans will be made for the use of land, adjusting the structure of land used for different purposes and making the best use of land that has already been made available. 
18. Improving the system for the strictest possible management of water resources
To give priority to saving water, achieve harmony between development and water conservation, carry out systemic governance, and ensure that both government and market play their respective roles, the system for controlling total water usage will be improved to ensure water security. Efforts will be accelerated to formulate water allocation plans for major river basins, strengthen coordination between provincial-level governments, and improve the system of targets for control of total water usage at the provincial, municipal, and county levels. Effective mechanisms will be established to ensure economical and intensive water usage. More work will be done to adjust the way water resources are used and improve their allocation. The system for evaluating the impact of plans and construction projects on water resources will be improved. Efforts will be made to draw principally on pricing and taxation to gradually establish systems for controlling and instituting quota-based management of the volume of water used in irrigation, and for controlling and instituting quota-based management of the planned water usage of high-water-consuming industrial enterprises. In regions seriously affected by water scarcity, water quotas will be used as a threshold for market entry and the development of high-water-consuming projects will be strictly controlled. The protection and environmental restoration of areas producing aquatic products will be strengthened, their aqua culture will be controlled, and mechanisms will be established for the protection of aquatic plant and animal life. Regulation of water functional zones will be improved and systems for promoting the utilization of alternative water resources will be established.
19. Establishing a system for total energy consumption management and energy conservation
High priority will be given to energy conservation, the control of energy intensity will be strengthened, and the responsibility system and the system of incentives for meeting energy conservation targets will be improved. Improvements will be made to the energy statistics system. The management system for energy conservation by major energy-consuming organizations will be improved, and a mechanism for making voluntary pledges on energy conservation will be implemented on an explorative basis. The system of energy conservation standards will be improved to make timely updates to energy efficiency standards for energy-consuming products, limits on energy consumption for energy-intensive industries, and energy efficiency standards for buildings. A reasonable target will be established for total national energy consumption and broken down and assigned to the provincial-level and major energy-consuming organizations. The mechanism for promoting the use of energy-saving, low-carbon products, technologies, and equipment will be improved and lists of technologies will be issued at regular intervals. Supervision over energy conservation will be strengthened. Stronger support will be provided for the development of renewable energy sources, and subsidies for all fossil fuels will be phased out. A system for controlling total national carbon emissions and a mechanism for breaking down the responsibility for implementation will be gradually established. A mechanism for effectively increasing forest, grassland, wetland, and ocean carbon sinks will be set up. China’s involvement in international cooperation on responding to climate change will be strengthened. (more)
20. Establishing a system for protecting virgin forests
All virgin forests will be placed under protection. A national timber forest reserve system will be established. Government administration will be gradually separated from the management of state-owned forests, and the public benefit forest protection and management system will be improved for state-owned forestry farms drawing principally on service procurement. The collective forest tenure system will be improved. Tenure contracts for collective forests will be kept stable, the operations allowed under these contracts will be expanded, and the systems by which forest tenure rights are used as collateral for loans and tenure rights are transferred will be improved.
21. Establishing a system for protecting grassland
The system by which collective grassland is contracted out for operation to individual households will be kept stable and improved to ensure that the plot and area of every piece of grassland contracted out is measured accurately, contracts are signed, and contracting certificates are granted. Proper procedures will be introduced for the transfer of grassland under such contracts. A system for protecting basic grassland will be put into effect to ensure that the area of basic grassland does not diminish, its quality does not deteriorate, and it is not converted for any other use. The subsidy and award mechanisms for the ecological conservation of grassland will be improved. Grazing on certain areas of grassland will be banned or temporarily suspended, rotational paddock grazing will be introduced, and efforts will be made to strike a balance between grass and livestock. Oversight over there view and approval of grassland requisitions will be strengthened and the use of grassland for any purpose other than animal husbandry will be strictly controlled.
22. Establishing a system for protecting wetlands
All wetlands will be placed under protection, and the unauthorized requisition or occupancy of wetlands of international importance, and those of national importance,and wetland reserves will be banned. The services of wetlands will be determined, their protection and utilization will be standardized, and a mechanism for the ecological restoration of wetlands will be established.
23. Establishing a system for closing off desertified land for protection
Contiguous areas of desertified land for which conditions are not currently in place to carry out anti-desertification programs will be designated as closed-off protection zones. Systems for strict protection will be established, construction of infrastructure needed to close off and protect and manage such zones will be stepped up, desertified land governance will be strengthened, and vegetation will be increased. The appropriate development of the sand industry will be encouraged. The mechanisms for protection and management drawing principally on service procurement will be improved. New approaches that combine development with governance will be explored. 
24. Improving the system for developing and protecting marine resources
Marine functional zones will be established, the major functions of offshore waters and islands will be determined, and efforts will be made to guide, control, and standardize behavior related to the use of oceans and islands. A system will be introduced to control total sea reclamation, imposing binding limits on the total area of ocean over which reclamation can take place. A system will be established for maintaining natural coastlines. The system for managing total marine fishery resources will be improved. The systems for instituting fishing off-seasons and bans on fishing will be strictly enforced. Limits on offshore fishing will be imposed. The scale of offshore and mudflat aquaculture will be controlled.
25. Improving the system for managing the development and utilization of mineral resources
A system for the investigation and evaluation of the development and utilization of mineral resources will be established. The ascertainment and registration of mineral resources and registration management of their pay-per-time occupation will be strengthened. A mechanism for the intensive development of mineral resources will be established, the concentration of enterprises in mining areas will be increased, and large-scale development is encouraged. National standards including those regarding the mining recovery rate of major mineral resources, ore dressing recovery rate, and the comprehensive utilization rate of mineral resources will be improved. The economic policies for encouraging better utilization of mineral resources will be refined. A system will be established to make available to the public information on whether mining enterprises are utilizing mineral resources efficiently and comprehensively, and a system will be set up for blacklisting those breaking mining operation rules. The mechanism for introducing industry-based approaches will be improved to support the recycling of major mineral resources. The systems for protecting the geological environment in mining areas and reclaiming deserted areas will also be improved.
26. Improving the system of resource recycling
An effective system will be established to record resource-output ratio statistics. The extended producer responsibility (EPR) system will be put into effect, pushing producers to perform their responsibilities for take-back and disposal of their end-of-life products. A system will be established to utilize farming, livestock, and aquaculture waste and achieve the organic integration and circular development of farming, husbandry, and aquaculture. The establishment of a system for making the separation of waste compulsory will be accelerated. A list of renewable resources to be recycled will be worked out and the mandatory recycling of composite packaging, batteries, agricultural plastic sheeting, and other low-value waste will be required. Efforts will be accelerated to develop standards for the recycling and reuse of resources by type. A system for promoting the use of products and raw materials made of recycled resources will be established to require enterprises consuming related raw materials to use a certain proportion of recycled products. The system for restricting the use of single-use disposable products will be improved. Taxation policies will be implemented and improved to promote the comprehensive utilization of resources and the development of the circular economy. A list of circular economy technologies will be formulated and policies such as priority government procurement and discounted interest on loans will be implemented. 

VI. Improving the System for Payment-Based Resource Consumption and Compensating Conservation and Protection Efforts
27. Accelerating price reform for natural resources and their products
In line with the principles of cost-benefit balancing and based on full consideration of society’ s ability to tolerate price increases, a cost assessment mechanism for natural resource exploitation and consumption will be established to incorporate the interests of resource owners and any ecological and environmental damage into the pricing mechanism for natural resources and their products. Price regulation over natural monopolies will be strengthened. A system will be created for overseeing and reviewing the pricing cost and a mechanism will be established for making pricing adjustments. Procedures for decision-making on pricing and the information disclosure system will be improved. The overall price reform of water for agricultural purposes will be moved forward. A system of progressive pricing for water will be put into full practice for non-household water consumption that exceeds plans or quotas for water consumption, and a system of tiered pricing for urban household water consumption will be fully implemented.
28. Improving the payment-based system for land use
The scope of state-owned land that is operated on the basis of a payment-based use system will be expanded. The proportion of land for which use rights can be transferred through bidding, auction, or listing will be enlarged. Less land will be allocated for non-public use. Income and expenditures related to selling use rights for state-owned land will be incorporated into public budgeting. Industrial-land supply methods will be reformed and improved, with the implementation of flexible transfer periods, long-term leasing, lease-then-sell arrangements, and lease-and-sell arrangements being explored. The mechanisms for setting and appraising land prices will be improved. The system of grade-based pricing for land will be refined. The relationship of land-related transaction and lease expenses with taxes and fees will be straightened out. An effective regulatory mechanism will be put in place to achieve reasonable price parity between industrial-use and residential-use land. Prices of industrial-use land will be raised, and the proportion of industrial-use land will be reduced. Methods such as land contracting and leasing out will be explored to improve the payment-based use system for state-owned land for agricultural use.
29. Improving the payment-based system for mineral resource use
Improvements will be made to the system for the sale of mining rights, and means suited to a market economy and the nature of the mining industry will be established for the sale of prospecting and extraction rights. In principle, the sale of these rights will be market-oriented, and the income and expenditures related to the sale of state-owned mineral resources will be incorporated into public budgeting. The property rights of owners, investors, and operators during the processes of payment-based acquisition, possession, and exploitation will be clarified, and research will be conducted into the development of a system of national premiums for the use of mineral resources. Standard fees for the use of prospecting and extraction rights, and minimum investment in mineral prospecting will be adjusted. Progress will be made in building a nationally unified mining rights exchange, and efforts in information disclosure on the sale and transfer of such rights will be intensified.
30. Improving the payment-based system for use of sea areas and offshore islands
A mechanism will be created for adjusting use fees for sea areas and uninhabited islands. An effective system will be established for the sale of use rights for sea areas and uninhabited islands through bidding, auction, and listing.
31. Accelerating reform of resource and environmental taxes and fees
The taxes and fees for natural resources and their products will be straightened out, their respective purposes will be clarified, and the appropriate scope of taxation regulation will be defined. Faster progress will be made in introducing price-based on resources. The scope of resource taxes will be gradually expanded to cover the use of all kinds of ecological spaces. A trial reform will be carried out in parts of northern China to levy a resource tax on groundwater. The development of legislation on environmental protection tax will also be accelerated. 
32. Improving the ecological compensation system
Explorations will be made into establishing a diversified compensation mechanism, transfer payments to major ecological functional zones will be increased step by step, and the incentive mechanism that links ecological protection performance with fund allocation will be improved. Measures will be drawn up for implementing a mechanism, principally for local compensation, and supported by additional funds from the central budget, by which local governments compensate each other for ecological or environmental damage and ecological conservation efforts. Local governments are encouraged to launch ecological compensation trials. Efforts will continue in carrying out the ecological compensation pilot initiative for the Xin’ an River ecosystem. Help will be given to carry out trans-regional ecological compensation pilot initiatives in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei water source conservation area, in areas along the Jiuzhou River in Guangxi and Guangdong, and in areas along the Ting and Han rivers in Fujian and Guangdong. Explorations will be made into carrying out pilot ecological compensation initiatives in the Yangtze River basin- an environmentally sensitive region.
33. Improving the mechanism for utilizing ecological protection and restoration funds
Given the need for systematic governance of mountains, forests, farmland, rivers, and lakes, the measures for utilizing and managing relevant funds will be improved and existing policies and channels will be integrated. At the same time as efforts are being made to comprehensively improve the conditions of rivers throughout their entire drainage basins,more funds will be spent on the protection and restoration of national ecological-security shields, such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau ecological shield, the Loess Plateau-Sichuan-Yunnan ecological shield, the northeast China forest belt, the northern China desertification-prevention belt, and the southern China mountainous belt.
34. Creating a recuperation system for farmland, grasslands, rivers, and lakes
A recuperation plan will be formulated for farmland, grassland, rivers, and lakes, adjusting the use of farmland in areas where there is heavy pollution or where groundwater has been over-extracted. Basic agricultural activity from land sloped greater than 25 degrees, which is not suitable for, and the ecosystem of which is harmed by, cultivation, will be gradually excluded from classification as basic cropland. A permanent mechanism will be formulated to consolidate progress in returning farmland to forest and grassland and converting grazing land back into grassland. Pilot projects will be launched to return cultivated land to lakes and wetlands. Efforts will be made to move forward with the pilot initiative for the restoration of heavy-metal contaminated soil in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan region, as well as the pilot project to comprehensively deal with the over-extraction of groundwater in northern China.

VII. Establishing an Effective System for Environmental Governance
35. Improving the pollutant emissions permit system
A unified and fair business emissions permit system covering all fixed pollution sources will be established quickly nationwide. Emissions permits will be issued in accordance with the law. Emission of pollutants without a permit or in violation of a permit will be prohibited.
36. Establishing a mechanism for cooperation within a region in pollution prevention and control
Cooperative mechanisms for joint prevention and control of air pollution will be improved in major areas such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta. Regional cooperation mechanisms will be established in other areas, taking into consideration their geographical features, levels of pollution, distribution of urban space, and patterns of pollutant transmission. Trials for creating new administrative systems for environmental protection will be held in some areas, using unified plans, standards, environmental evaluations, monitoring, and law enforcement. Trials will also be launched for the establishment of environmental regulators and administrative law enforcement agencies for river basins. A variety of cooperative mechanisms for protecting the water environments of river basins as well as early-warning systems for risk control will be put in place with the participation of the relevant provincial-level water-related departments within each river basin. An integrated mechanism for pollution prevention and control both on land and at sea and a control system governing the total quantity of pollutants discharged into key marine areas will be set up. The mechanism for responding to environmental emergencies will be improved and China’ s capacity for dealing with environmental emergencies of varying degrees of severity and involving different pollutants will be strengthened. 
37. Establishing systems and mechanisms for rural environmental governance
An eco-oriented system of agricultural subsidies will be created. Efforts to formulate and improve relevant technical standards and specifications will be accelerated. Reductions to the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic sheeting and the recycling or safe disposal of animal husbandry waste will be carried out quickly. The production and use of biodegradable plastic sheeting is encouraged. The system for comprehensively utilizing crop straw will be improved. Networks for recycling, storing, transporting, and processing plastic sheeting and chemical fertilizer and pesticide packaging will be improved. Development of environmental protection facilities, such as those for handling rural wastewater and refuse, will be bolstered by subsidies from governments and village collectives, fee payments from residents, and the participation of non-government capital. A variety of assistive measures, including government procurement of services, will be adopted to foster and develop market entities for the control of all types of agricultural pollution from non-point sources and for the handling of rural wastewater and refuse. County- and township-level governments will carry greater responsibility for environmental protection, and efforts to build their capacity for environmental regulation will be boosted. In allocating government funds for supporting agriculture, full consideration should be given to improving overall agricultural production capacity and to preventing and controlling rural pollution.
38. Improving systems for public disclosure of environmental information
Extensive efforts will be made to ensure public availability of environmental information pertaining to the atmosphere, water, and so on, to businesses that emit pollution, and to regulatory bodies. The mechanism for the public release of environmental impact evaluations for development projects will be improved. The environmental spokesperson system will be refined. Efforts will be made to promote awareness for environmental protection among the general public, the system of public participation will be improved, and more work needs to be done to ensure that the people exercise oversight over the environment in a legal and orderly way. An online platform and system will be created for the reporting of offenses related to environmental protection, and systems for offense-reporting, hearings, and public opinion-based oversight will be improved.
39. Strictly implementing compensation systems for ecological and environmental damage
Manufacturers’ legal responsibilities for environmental protection will be tightened, and the cost of illegal activities will be significantly increased. Legal provisions concerning environmental damage compensation, methods for appraising damage, and mechanisms for enforcing compensation will be improved. In accordance with the law, penalties will be meted out to those who violate environmental laws and regulations, compensation for ecological and environmental damage will be determined by the extent of damage and other factors, and when violations result in serious adverse consequences, criminal liability will be pursued.
40. Improving the administrative system for environmental protection
An effective administrative system for environmental protection will be established to strictly regulate the emissions of all pollutants. Duties and responsibilities for environmental protection, which are currently spread across departments, will be assigned to one single department, progressively creating a system whereby one department is responsible for unified regulation and administrative law enforcement over urban and rural environmental protection work. Regulatory authority from different fields and departments and at different levels will be systemically organized to create a unified and authoritative system for environmental law enforcement, strengthen the ranks of law enforcement, and provide those tasked with environmental law enforcement the necessary conditions and means to enforce the law. The mechanisms linking administrative law enforcement and environmental judicial work will be improved. 

VIII. Improving the Market System for Environmental Governance and Ecological Conservation
41. Fostering market entities for environmental governance and ecological conservation
Systems, mechanisms, policies, and measures that encourage energy efficient and environmentally friendly industries will be adopted. Regulations and practices that hinder fair competition and the creation of a nationally unified market will be discontinued, and all types of investment will be encouraged to enter the environmental protection market. Non-government investors may participate in the development and operation of any environmental governance or ecological conservation program where cooperation between government and non-government investment is viable. By means of government procurement of services and other methods, more support will be provided for third-party governance of environmental pollution. The transformation of organizations in charge of the operation and management of wastewater and refuse treatment facilities into companies that exercise independent accounting and management will be accelerated. Companies that take investment from or are operated with state capital will be set up or created through reorganization in order to encourage greater investment of state capital into environmental governance and ecological conservation. Support will be given to state-owned firms in fields of ecological and environmental protection to reform toward a mixed-ownership system.
42. Promoting the trading of energy-use rights and carbon emissions rights
Combined with efforts to see that major energy-consuming organizations increase energy efficiency and to subject new projects to energy reviews, the trading of energy saved on projects will be allowed, and will progressively move toward the trading of energy-use rights based on the cap system for energy consumption. A trading system and a measurement and verification system for energy-use rights will be established. Energy performance contracting will be promoted. Trials of carbon emissions rights trading will be deepened, a national exchange for carbon emissions rights will be progressively created, and a national plan for setting the total trade and quota allocation of carbon emissions rights will be formulated. The carbon trading registration system will be improved and a regulatory system will be established for the carbon emissions rights exchange.
43. Promoting the trading of pollution rights
On the basis of the cap system for enterprise pollution emissions,improvements will be made as quickly as possible to the granting of initial pollution rights, and coverage will be expanded to include more pollutants. Working from the foundations provided by the current mechanism for granting pollution rights to administrative regions, and on the basis of the best industry-wide levels of pollution emissions, the mechanism will be gradually strengthened to ensure the cap system for enterprise pollution emissions is implemented and the trading of pollution rights creates incentives for emissions reductions at the level of the individual enterprise. In key river basins and key areas for air pollution, implementation of pollution rights trading across administrative regions will be carried out as appropriate. Trials for the payment-based use and trading of pollution rights will be expanded to include more areas where conditions are appropriate. Efforts will be stepped up to improve the pollution rights exchange. Regulations will be developed on granting pollution rights, collecting and using pollution rights use fees, and setting trading prices.
44. Promoting the trading of water rights
Combined with efforts to establish an effective mechanism for compensating the expenses of water ecosystem protection and conservation, water-related rights will be appropriately defined and allocated and ways of trading water rights between regions, between river basins, between the lower and upper reaches of rivers, between industries, and between water users will be explored. Research will be conducted into formulating regulations concerning the trading of water rights, to clearly define the scope and types of tradable water rights, the trading entities and time frames, the mechanisms for determining trading prices, and the rules for the operation of the exchange. An exchange for water rights will be developed. 
45. Establishing a green finance system
Green credit will be promoted, with research being undertaken into adopting methods such as government interest subsidies to boost the level of support. All types of financial institutions are encouraged to step up grants of green loans. Requirements for the due diligence of borrowers as well as their legal responsibilities concerning environmental protection will be clarified. Efforts will be stepped up to further develop the systems related to capital markets. Research will be conducted to explore the establishment of a green stock index and the development of relevant investment products, and studies will be undertaken to explore the issuance of green bonds by banks and enterprises, encouraging the securitization of green credit assets. Support will be given for the launch of multiple types of green development funds, the operations of which will be market-based. A mechanism will be established for the mandatory release of environmental protection information by listed companies. Guaranty mechanisms for energy-efficient, low-carbon, and environmentally friendly projects will be improved, and the level of risk compensation increased. A compulsory liability insurance system for environmental pollution will be established in sectors involving high environmental risks. A green rating system as well as a non-profit system for calculating environmental costs and evaluating environmental impact will be established. Cooperation of all types with other countries will be promoted in green finance.
46. Establishing a unified system for green products
Products that are licensed as environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, water-saving, circular, low-carbon, recyclable, or organic will be uniformly classified as green products, and standardized green product standards, certifications, and logos will be established for them. Improvements will be made to policies on fiscal and tax support and government procurement for the research and development, production, transport, delivery, purchase, and use of green products.

IX. Improving Ecological Conservation Performance Evaluation and Accountability Systems
47. Establishing ecological conservation targets
Research will be conducted into developing practicable and visually representable indicators for assessing green development. Measures will be put in place to evaluate the attainment of ecological conservation targets, and indicators for resource consumption, environmental damage, and ecological benefit will be incorporated into a comprehensive evaluation system for economic and social development. Different performance evaluation criteria will be applied to different regions on the basis of their functional zoning.
48. Establishing monitoring and early-warning mechanisms for environmental and resource carrying capacity
Research will be undertaken into developing indicators and applying the right technology for monitoring and producing early warnings about resource and environmental carrying capacity. Monitoring and early-warning databases and IT platforms will be created for resources and the environment. Reports on monitoring and early-warning about resource and environmental carrying capacity will be prepared at regular intervals, and warnings will be issued and measures taken to place restrictions on regions which have exceeded or are approaching their carrying capacity in terms of resource consumption and environmental capacity.
49. Exploring the creation of balance sheets for natural resource assets
Guidelines will be formulated on preparing balance sheets for natural resource assets. Asset and liability accounting methods will be developed for use with water, land, forest, and other types of resources; accounts will be established for accounting natural resources in physical terms; classificatory criteria and statistical standards will be clearly laid out; and changes in natural resource assets will be regularly assessed. The preparation of balance sheets for natural resource assets will take place on a trial basis at the municipal (county) level, with physical accounts of major natural resource assets being assessed and results released. 
50. Auditing outgoing officials’ management of natural resource assets
On the basis of the preparation of balance sheets for natural resource assets and making reasonable allowance for objective natural factors, active efforts will be made to explore the objectives, content, methods, and appraisal indicators for auditing outgoing officials’ management of natural resource assets. Based on the changes in natural resource assets within their area of jurisdiction during their term of office, through auditing, an objective evaluation will be carried out of the outgoing official’ s management of natural resource assets; an official’ s liability will be determined in accordance with the law, and auditing results will be put to better use. Trials for preparing balance sheets for natural resource assets and for audits of the management of natural resource assets by outgoing officials will be conducted in the cities of Hulun Buir in Inner Mongolia, Huzhou in Zhejiang, Loudi in Hunan, Chishui in Guizhou, and Yan’ an in Shaanxi.
51. Establishing a lifelong accountability system for ecological and environmental damage
Leaders of local CPC committees and governments will be responsible for both economic development and ecological progress. On the basis of the results of the natural resource asset audits of outgoing officials and ecological and environmental damage, the circumstances under which the principal leaders of local CPC committees and governments, related leaders, and departmental leaders will be held accountable and the procedures for confirming accountability will be made clear. Those responsible for ecological and environmental damage will, on the basis of the severity of misconduct, be reprimanded, required to make a public apology, or dealt with through organizational, Party, or disciplinary action. For circumstances which constitute a criminal act, criminal liability will be pursued in accordance with the law. A system of lifelong accountability will be put into effect for major ecological and environmental damage which becomes apparent after an official has left office and for which he or she is found liable. A national supervision and inspection system for environmental protection will be established.

X. Ensuring Successful Implementation of the Reform to Promote Ecological Progress
52. Strengthening leadership over the reform to promote ecological progress
All local governments and departments need to study the central leadership’ s guiding principles on making ecological progress and carrying out reform to this effect, develop a deep understanding of the tremendous significance of this reform, and strengthen their sense of responsibility, sense of purpose, and sense of urgency over its implementation. Local governments and departments need to do their utmost to put into effect the policy decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and see to it that all objectives contained within this reform plan are carried out quickly. In accordance with the requirements set out in this plan, all government departments concerned should promptly draw up plans for implementing each item of the reform, delegate responsibility and set time frames, and through close cooperation and collaboration with others create a concerted reform effort. 
53. Launching pilot initiatives and explorative projects
Both the central and local governments will play an active role. All local governments are encouraged, in line with the direction of reform set out in this plan, to proactively explore and move forward with the reform to promote ecological progress,treating their local conditions as their point of departure and the solving of serious ecological and environmental problems as their target. Reforms that require legal authorization should be handled in accordance with statutory procedures. Comprehensive pilot initiatives for achieving ecological progress being conducted independently by different government departments will be incorporated into national pilot initiatives and explorative projects and will receive guidance and encouragement from those authorities whose own functions put them in a position to provide such support.
54. Improving laws and regulations
Legislative support will be provided for the reform to promote ecological progress through the development of effective laws and regulations on property rights for natural resource assets, the development and protection of territorial space, national parks, spatial planning, seas, responses to climate change, protection of cropland quality, water conservation and groundwater management, grassland and wetland preservation, pollutant emission permits, and compensation for ecological and environmental damage.
55. Improving guidance on public communication
Publicity both in China and abroad on efforts to promote ecological progress and carry out the reform to this effect will be stepped up. This will require coordinated planning and accurate interpretations of each of the systems and the direction of reform-all designed to promote ecological progress. It should cultivate and popularize eco-culture, raise public awareness about ecological progress, and advocate a green life-style, thereby creating a positive social atmosphere in which efforts to promote eco-progress are viewed with respect, and which will help to promote ecological progress and the reform designed to bring about it.
56. Exercising stricter supervision over reform implementation
The office of the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reform and the leading group’ s Reform Taskforce for the Promotion of Economic Development and Ecological Progress should strengthen its overall coordination, carry out follow-up analyses and supervisory inspections over the implementation of this plan, accurately interpret and promptly resolve any problems arising during its implementation, and promptly report any major issues to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.

			China issues guideline to promote opening up






Updated:
Sep 18,2015 9:01 AM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China issued a guideline on Sept 17 to open the economy wider to the outside world.
The government will continue to improve foreign capital management, encourage outbound investment, stabilize foreign trade and explore global cooperation, according to a document released by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.
A negative list, which identifies sectors and businesses that are off-limits for investment, will be issued; certain controls will be loosened; and supervision enhanced, the guideline said.
The service sector — including finance, education, culture and healthcare — will be more accessible to foreign investors, while restrictions on child- and old-age care, architectural design, accounting, auditing, logistics and e-commerce will be lifted. China will also further open the manufacturing industry.
As part of economic rebalancing, China is pushing forward with opening up in more sectors.
Zhang Yansheng, secretary-general of the academic committee of the National Development and Reform Commission, said China wanted to create a stable, open and transparent business environment to attract more capital, talent and technology and speed up restructuring.
Meanwhile, the guideline said, the government will boost outbound investment.
Companies will be encouraged to invest in infrastructure, energy and resources around the world, while advantageous industries including high-speed rail, nuclear power, aviation and machinery will be promoted globally.
Chinese enterprises invested a total of $123.12 billion overseas in 2014, up 14.2 percent year on year.
Zhang Xiangchen, vice negotiation representative for international trade at the Ministry of Commerce, expects outbound investment to continue to grow and surpass capital inflow.
According to the guideline, the government will cut red tape and simplify customs clearance to facilitate trade. Experts believe the policies will relieve exporters, and boost growth in international trade.
In terms of service trade, the guideline said the government will continue to boost the sector, continuing with the upgrade through Internet technology, such as big data and mobile networks, achieve international standards and enhance outsourcing.
Bucking lackluster goods trade, the service trade posted double-digit growth in the first half of the year.
In addition, the guideline said China will continue to promote multilateral trade, stick to win-win cooperation and oppose protectionism. It will establish a network of free trade areas (FTAs) to carry forward global cooperation.
China has signed 14 FTAs with countries including Iceland, Switzerland, the Republic of Korea and Australia.

			Measures to support entrepreneurship and innovation






Updated:
Sep 26,2015 12:13 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued a circular on Sept 26 to support the ongoing reform of mass entrepreneurship and innovation and the Internet Plus initiative with four measures: popular entrepreneurship, crowd-sourcing, collective support for small and micro businesses and start-ups, and crowd-funding.
The four measures are in fact the platforms that the government is trying to build to support popular entrepreneurship and innovation and the Internet Plus initiative, which will inject more dynamism and innovation into the economy.
According to the State Council, the four measures will work together to create a better environment and opportunities for the market, optimizing allocation of resources and providing new platforms for popular entrepreneurship and innovation.
Aimed at gathering innovation resources from society and lowering costs for innovation, popular entrepreneurship is one of the important measures to attract and support individual intellectuals. It does this by integrating science park and business incubators with Internet platforms and encouraging leading Internet technology companies to provide open platforms for small and micro businesses and start-ups.
Crowd-sourcing is a method that enterprises and institutions use to outsource businesses or operations to smaller companies or individuals with the help of Internet technology so that efficiency will be improved and costs will be cut.
Collective efforts will be made to jointly support small and micro businesses and start-ups. According to the State Council, universities and scientific research institutions will be encouraged to open scientific research facilities for small and micro businesses and start-ups and large and medium enterprises will be encouraged to support them by establishing open platforms and sharing resources. Also, open-source communities, developer communities, resource-sharing platforms, donating platforms and entrepreneurship salons will be encouraged to build up mass support for entrepreneurship and innovation.
Crowd-funding also is a significant measure to support popular entrepreneurship and innovation by raising funds from society via the Internet to meet financing needs for small and micro businesses and start-ups.
To carry out the measures, supporting financial and tax policies will be implemented and a better market environment will be created with appropriate regulations, the State Council’s circular said.

Aug 24,2015 3:53 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued a circular on Aug 24 concerning a trial run for rural contract land mortgages and rural housing property mortgages to help expand financing reform in rural areas.
The move is aimed at innovating mortgage practices in rural areas so that resources, capital, and assets could be efficiently allocated and used to inject more capital into agriculture production, increasing farmers’ income and speeding up modernization in rural areas.
The trial run will streamline the loan management procedures, encourage financing institutions to offer mid- and long-term loans, establish risk protection mechanism, and require the People’s Bank of China to offer support to financial institutions.
It will be carried out in counties, county-level cities, and city districts that meet the following standards: property transfer market is flourishing and healthy; farmers have a strong will in land transfer; and rural credit environment is preferable.
The People’s Bank of China will coordinate with the Office of Central Rural Work Leading Group, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Land and Resources, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, Ministry of Agriculture, and other government departments to implement the plan.
According to the circular, the trial run will be done before the end of 2017.

The General Office of the State Council issued a circular concerning the development of China’s financial leasing industry on Sept 7 to further boost and upgrade its economy.
The industry has in recent years witnessed dramatic development concerning market size and its role in economic upgrades and growth. But there is still a long way to go as it lags far behind developed markets.

The circular stressed accelerating efforts in financial leasing services for medium, small, and micro businesses, strengthening the development of cross-border financial leasing services, innovating financial leasing business modes and enhancing regulation of the industry.
Legislation will be enacted to establish a fair, disciplined and well-regulated business environment for the industry.
The government will also improve fiscal and taxation policies to support the development of the industry by offering subsidies and risk compensation.
Financial institutions are encouraged to strengthen supporting efforts to companies which could also be able to finance from the bond market, foreign debt, foreign exchange and industry funds, expanding financing channels for the industry.
To develop the industry, a well-regulated statistical system and evaluation index will be built and more well-trained professionals will be needed, the circular noted.

			State Council seeks to boost domestic trade circulation






Updated:
Aug 28,2015 5:34 PM
	    english.gov.cn












A State Council document released on Aug 28 pledges further innovation, the integration of regional networks and the improvement of a supervisory system to boost domestic trade circulation, in support of the national economy. 
In the next five years, China plans to establish an open and unified, innovation-driven and well-regulated circulation system for domestic trade, which is expected to become a new engine for economic restructuring and transformation of development models. 
The State Council requested eliminating market segmentation and breaking industry monopolies to build a unified national market, which will further reduce costs for social circulation. 
The country will make overall plans for the development of areas such as Bohai rim region, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, and geographic belts such as Shenyang-Changchun-Harbin, Zhengzhou-Wuhan-Changsha, Chengdu-Chongqing, Xi’an-Lanzhou-Urumqi, where circulation industries cluster, to construct a series of high-potential interworking cities that would connect domestic and global markets. Commercial networks and centers are also expected to get a boost in rural areas. 
Circulation companies that are focused on investing abroad will receive further support. The government will plan the development of foreign economic and trade cooperation zones to facilitate the overseas extension of domestic circulation channels. China will also further open up its domestic trade circulation to foreign capitals, with an emphasis on advanced technology, management expertise and commercial models. 
In another aspect, the government will increase financial assistance and improve support services to promote the innovation of new circulation models, the transformation of traditional companies, and the green and low-carbon development model. The “Internet Plus” initiative will be adopted to accelerate the digitalization of the circulation. 
Additionally, the State Council asked to speed up legislation on commodity circulation to guarantee that fundamental regulations cover facility construction, order maintenance, industry development and market supervision. 
The document also urged local governments to formulate standards for the circulation industry, construct a credit system for related enterprises and strengthen the enforcement of regulations.

A State Council document released on Sept 10 lays out an action plan for the first phase of reform of technical standardization (2015-16), vowing to steer Chinese standards to international norms. 
According to the plan, the government will evaluate current mandatory standards on a national, local and industrial scale, and eliminate the ones that are obsolete. Those no longer requiring compliance will be turned into recommended standards, and those that require compliance will be revised and integrated. 
Similar measures will also be applied to the current recommended standards, on which a thorough review will help abolish outdated standards and amend the ones that lag behind industrial and technological development. 
The government will encourage Chinese enterprises, industrial technology alliances and social organizations to participate in international standardization efforts and create an open and transparent environment for foreign capital to flow into China’s standardization reform. 
Furthermore, governments are urged to formulate plans for Chinese standards in the industries of railway, electricity, steel, aerospace and nuclear to “go abroad”, focusing on strategic initiatives such as “One Belt, One Road” and “Made in China 2025”. 
The State Council will provide reinforced budget and regulation support to further advance the reform.

The State Council published a plan on Aug 20 concerning the layout of the main functional areas of China’s oceans, with the aim of optimizing marine development and improving the utilization efficiency of oceans to ensure sustainable development.
As part of the country’s overall plan for main functional areas, the plan published on Aug 20 will serve as the basis for shaping the distribution of main functional areas and it will help the authorities monitor marine development.
Regarding main functions, the plan divides ocean space into four types: areas that have been intensively exploited and should be developed in an optimal manner as resources are being depleted, areas that still have great potential and rich resources and should be key development areas, and areas of limited development or where development is prohibited. 
The plan clearly categorizes the four types of areas in relation to China’s inland waters, territorial seas, exclusive economic zones, continental shelves, and other sea areas under China’s jurisdiction (excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan).
It also details the future development and exploitation principals for these areas.
Central departments and local governments in coastal areas are required to strengthen coordination and ensure the implementation of favorable policies concerning finance and taxation and investment and the environment - in an ethical and honest manner. 
The authorities are also responsible for making plans and concrete measures to carry out the tasks described in this plan.

China has decided to pilot reforms in its domestic trade and circulation system in nine cities, the State Council’s General Office said in a statement on August 6.
The General Office made the announcement to the Ministry of Commerce and the nine provincial governments where the selected cities are located.
The nine cities are: Shanghai, Nanjing in Jiangsu province, Zhengzhou in Henan province, Guangzhou in Guangdong province, Chengdu in Sichuan province, Xiamen in Fujian province, Qingdao in Shandong province, Huangshi in Hubei province and Yiwu in Zhejiang province.
The municipal governments of the nine cities are required to work out plans for the pilot program, which must be submitted to the Ministry of Commerce. 
The municipal governments have also been assigned tasks in four areas: to explore an innovation-driven circulation development mechanism, which highlights the role of e-commerce; establish a business environment that adheres to basic regulations, and upholds a supervisory mechanism and credit system; guide the construction of infrastructure catering for different modes in the process of circulation, including wholesale farm produce markets, community service outlets and large-scale shopping centers; improve the governments’ management.
Following a trial lasting one year, the nine cities are expected to share their experience in terms of innovative circulation mechanism, market regulation, infrastructure development, and management system, which will lay a solid foundation to build a unified domestic market, and provide valuable insights for the country’s overall reform in the domestic trade and circulation system.
The Ministry of Commerce and another eight ministries will assess the progress of the pilot program in a timely manner, and submit the results to the State Council.

Updated:

	    english.gov.cn












China will promote a mechanism of random inspections to regulate government supervisory activities, with the aim of ensuring a fair market environment and to “foster entrepreneurship among the masses”, the State Council General Office said in a circular issued on Aug 5.
The circular asks local governments and departments under the State Council to compile a list concerning random inspections and establish a “two-way random inspection” mechanism — which involves selecting both the targets of the inspections and the inspectors randomly.
Local governments and departments are also required to establish a “reasonable ratio and frequency” for the inspections, punish illegal behavior as a sort of deterrent, and make information concerning the results of the inspections available to the general public in a timely manner.
Additionally, the circular requires local governments and departments to carry out supervisory activities in accordance with the country’s laws and regulations, enhance equity and efficiency, promote transparency — and coordination among departments. 
In order to facilitate the process, China will speed up the building of a unified market supervisory information platform, and the results of the random inspections will be linked to the social credit system, the circular said. 
Local governments above the county level are required to coordinate relevant departments in order to jointly conduct random inspections, making it possible for different departments to carry out inspections of one market entity at the same time.
Local governments and departments under the State Council are expected to draft plans regarding the inspections. They are required to submit detailed lists of duties and timetables to the State Council’s coordination group for the government’s transformation of its functions — by the end of September 2015.

			Lanzhou urban construction plan gets green light






Updated:
Jul 20,2015 10:49 AM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council on July 20 approved a 10-year plan for urban construction in Lanzhou, capital city of Northwest China’s Gansu province, and situated on a strategic point along the Silk Road economic belt.
According to the plan, which outlined the major tasks for Lanzhou’s urban planning before 2020, efforts will be made to build the city into a key platform for China’s westward opening-up and develop it into a modern and green city with a thriving economy.
To ensure the goals, the authorities will pay particular attention to unified development of both urban and rural areas within a planning area of 5,810 square kilometers, by improving living conditions of villagers and promoting equal access to public services in urban and rural areas. 
By 2020 the permanent residential population in the central urban area will not exceed 2.75 million while urban construction will take place within an area of 250 square kilometers, ensuring the city is not burdened by unplanned population growth. 
Construction within the Lanzhou New Area, set up with the State Council’s approval in 2012, will ensure that Lanzhou plays a bigger role in promoting the development of Gansu province and neighboring areas, pushing forward the development of western regions, as well as facilitating China’s westward opening up. 
Efforts are also demanded to accelerate the infrastructure of external transportation systems, including highways, railways and airports, to boost city links with other areas. 
Moreover, the authorities will build the city into a resource-saving and environmentally friendly city and create a healthy environment for people living there. Meanwhile, the historical and cultural relics in Lanzhou will be fully protected.
The overall plan will serve as a guideline for Lanzhou’s urban development, construction and management, and all construction activities within the planning area must meet the plan’s requirements.

Updated:
Jul 29,2015 9:31 AM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — The Communist Party of China (CPC) has issued a regulation on the promotion and demotion of officials, according to the General Office of the CPC Central Committee on July 28.
The regulation said the CPC will strengthen its management of officials, adding a high-quality ranking system must be established to build a clean political environment.
The regulation aims to fix a longtime problem in China’s political system that allows officials to be promoted or stay at the same level, but does not let them be demoted unless they commit violations of CPC rules or the law.
The regulation said a qualified sitting official should adhere to CPC values, be honest, upright, responsible, diligent and effectively perform his duties. The CPC will promote capable officials, replace mediocre ones and sack the incapable and corrupt.
The CPC aims to invigorate the current official system by assigning capable officials to the proper posts and weeding out unhealthy work styles such as political idleness, neglect of duty and malpractice.
The CPC will implement the regulation by improving its accountability mechanism.
Officials found to be incompetent or lacking initiative to fulfill their tasks will be relieved from their current posts, the regulation said.

The State Council announced on July 23 its decision to cancel the requirement for special qualifications concerning workers in 62 professions, including artificial limb makers, and also its aim to cancel requirements for evaluations of online commercial agents and medical representatives.
The decision to cancel such qualifications and evaluation is an important part of the government’s effort to abolish certain administrative approval items and improve its service to the public, the State Council said in a statement. 
It also said that the country should further cancel professional qualifications or requirements in order to create a more favorable environment for professional talent and encourage innovation and mass entrepreneurship. 
Qualifications for entering a profession, required by departments under the State Council — but without any legal basis — should be canceled. And the evaluation of professionals that the State Council’s departments, national associations or institutes set up independently should also be canceled. 
The central and local authorities should speed up the compilation of a national list of professions that require qualifications or evaluations, and any requirements not on the list will be unacceptable, the State Council said.

The State Council issued a guideline on June 25 to support the development of the textile and clothing industry in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, with the aim of boosting employment and the urbanization drive. 
The rapid development of this industry is an important part of building Xinjiang into a “core area” of the Silk Road economic belt, according to the guideline issued by the General Office of the State Council 
It will also help to optimize the region’s economic structure, add more jobs, and accelerate the process of urbanization, thus bringing greater social order and stability to Xinjiang.
The government will strengthen guidance and let the market play a decisive role in allocating resources, in order to create a fair and competitive environment for the sustainable development of the industry.
Enterprises will play a major role in carrying on the industries transferred from eastern and central China, as well as fostering the textile and clothing industry and companies with local characteristics. Efforts will also be carried out to develop outbound markets in Central Asia, Russia and other European countries.
The guideline also listed the specific goals for the development of this industry in Xinjiang, including:
By 2020, the scale and technologies of the cotton textile industry in Xinjiang will rank top across the country; the clothing and clothing accessories industry, home textile industry and the knitting industry will begin to take shape; the cultivation of industries with local characteristics such as handmade carpets will see remarkable progress; employment will be obviously boosted and Xinjiang will be basically built into an important national base of the cotton textile industry and a production base for clothing and clothing accessories in the Northwestern region and the core area of the Silk Road economic belt. 
To ensure the goals, the central government will carry out a series of polices and measures including increasing financial input into the development of the textile and clothing industry in Xinjiang, studying and formulating financial measures to guide banking institutions in the region to give a priority to the industry when offering loans. 
The local government in Xinjiang is also encouraged to guarantee public services for the industrial development by introducing supportive policies.

			State Council issues statement on budget efficiency






Updated:
Jun 19,2015 9:27 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued a statement on June 19 to its ministries and provincial authorities to improve budget efficiency. The measures include:
1. Improve budget efficiency for government projects by speeding up review of the projects’ budget applications. Make sure that once the applications are approved, the projects can start spend according to those budgets.
Set up a system to monitor the progress of the projects. For those longer than a year, the government should grant budgets on an annual basis. For those that progress slowly, financial departments can redirect some of the funding to address public issues that need money badly.
2. Integrate different funds to use them more efficiently. The authorities should sort out various funds in the fields of science and technology, education, agriculture, energy efficiency, environmental protection and healthcare. For example, the various funds for science development managed by different ministries and departments should be integrated into five national science funds; funds for energy efficiency and environmental protection should be integrated into six categories, such as separate funds for air and water pollution treatment.The authorities should invest more of the increased section of education budgets into remote and impoverished areas or areas where ethnic groups live to improve educational equity. 
3. Have financial departments distribute budgets for all other departments at their level. Financial departments budgets also should include special funds granted by the central government for infrastructure construction or science development. Financial departments can reduce or cancel the budget for government projects already supported by special funds.
4. Continue to include government funds, that is, funds that authorities collect by charging fees for addressing special public purposes, into general public budgets, which are mainly funded by taxes.
5. Better coordinate budgets that last for more than a fiscal year. Surplus in the general public budget should be directed to the budget stabilization fund. If the amount of money collected exceeds what the budget calls for, the extra funds should be used to balance deficit, pay for government debts or go to the budget stabilization fund. If the authorities haven’t collected enough money to fund planned budgets, they should narrow the gap by ways such as tapping into the budget stabilization fund or cutting spending. 
6. Regulate the use of various kinds of government income. The authorities should review and regulate government funds and other special funds, and gradually set up a government income system that mainly includes taxes, with non-tax income as a supplement.
7. Carry out the State Council’s decisions to make full use of budget stabilizing funds and revolving funds, as well as money left over from budgets that haven’t been fully implemented.
8. Coordinate budget planning with budget implementation. Authorities should not only make budgets scientifically and precisely, but also implement them strictly and efficiently.
9. Make better use of borrowed funds. Funds that local authorities have borrowed but haven’t used should be included in their budgets and managed accordingly.
10. Make better use of transfer payments. For issues that fall under the authority of the central government, the central government should try its best to pay for them. For issues that fall under the powers of local authorities, local authorities should pay for them, while the central government lends support by making transfer payments.

			China eyes better public service, stability at rural community






Updated:
Jun 1,2015 7:34 AM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China is pushing for greater stability and better public services at the country’s vast rural regions in a bid to shore up lagging civil service and advance urban-rural integration.
In a guidance document on advancing rural community establishment co-issued by the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, Party and government authorities asked provincial governments to pilot rural communities at selected villages, to accommodate “profound changes in the rural area” such as demographic changes and migrant population.
It said the establishment of rural communities is key to consolidating grassroots-level government and the Party’s rule.
In particular, local governments should explore ways to “standardize and institutionalize” democratic consultations at rural communities while sticking to self-governance at village-levels, and provide better public services to left-behind children, women and elders.
Local authorities are also asked to provide better legal aid in rural areas, help settle local disputes, enhance rural policing and carry out law education, in order to improve rural governance and rule of law.
Public service should be improved and more people should be encouraged to join volunteer services, the document said, adding that socialist core values should be promoted at grassroots levels while frugality and environmental protection awareness be strengthened.

			‘Made in China 2025’ plan issued






Updated:
May 19,2015 6:42 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued “Made in China 2025” plan on May 19, the country’s first ten-year action plan focusing on promoting manufacturing.
The plan proposed a “three step” strategy of transforming China into a leading manufacturing power by the year 2049, which marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
Nine tasks have been identified as priorities: improving manufacturing innovation, integrating technology and industry, strengthening the industrial base, fostering Chinese brands, enforcing green manufacturing, promoting breakthroughs in ten key sectors, advancing restructuring of the manufacturing sector, promoting service-oriented manufacturing and manufacturing-related service industries, and internationalizing manufacturing.
The above ten key sectors are:
1. New information technology 
2. High-end numerically controlled machine tools and robots 
3. Aerospace equipment 
4. Ocean engineering equipment and high-end vessels 
5. High-end rail transportation equipment 
6. Energy-saving cars and new energy cars 
7. Electrical equipment 
8. Farming machines 
9. New materials, such as polymers. 
10.Bio-medicine and high-end medical equipment. 
The country should also further open up its market and attract foreign investors to invest in key areas, such as the development of new information technology and bio-medicine, and foreign companies and institutions should be encouraged to set up R&D centers in China, it said. 
The plan, mentioned in the government work report for 2015, will upgrade manufacturing in line with the rapid advances in science and technology. 
Countries, both developed and developing, are reshaping their competitiveness as new technologies, including 3D printing, mobile Internet, cloud computing and new energy, emerge and China needs to urgently improve its ability to innovate and grasp these cutting-edge technologies, the plan states. 
The manufacturing sector’s ability to innovate will be enhanced as it embraces state-of-the-art information technology which will result in superior products. 
Basic techniques for the sector, such as those used for making key components and important materials, will also be improved under the plan. 
A greater emphasis will be placed on quality management in the sector and the nurturing of world-class brands, with environmental considerations and energy efficiency to the forefront, according to the plan.

China will adjust its trade structure, transform the development of foreign trade and move up the global value chain, according to a guideline issued by the State Council on May 12.
To ensure this goal, which will enhance its trade prowess, it will innovate business and trade modes, as well as opening up more areas, the guideline said. 
The current scale-driven and quick turnover foreign trade approach will be transformed into trade that is quality-driven and profit-oriented, the statement said.
The transformation will have five key aspects: exports will cover more areas including services and technology; instead of price advantage, the focus will be on competitive brand and quality; foreign trade growth will be mainly driven by innovation; laws and regulations will play a bigger role in creating an international business environment; and China will seek to participate in the formulation of rules governing global trade and the world economy.
The guideline also laid out specific tasks to meet the goal.
First, to vigorously boost the restructuring of foreign trade.
* Efforts will be doubled to make sure emerging markets, such as Latin America and Africa, occupy a bigger share of China’s foreign trade, while further developing traditional export markets in the United States, Europe and Japan. Imports of advanced technology and equipment will be expanded and exports of high-quality and high-grade products with comparative advantages will be boosted.
* Priority will be given to high-end industries and high-value added chains in eastern China to improve quality and profits, while support will be offered to the central and western regions to maintain the industries transferred from the east. 
* Facilitate the establishment of a group of large enterprises that are capable of global operations. The development of innovative, entrepreneurial and labor-intensive businesses of micro, small and medium sizes will be encouraged. The country will also support the development of export-oriented private enterprises that encourage innovation.
*The competitive edge in exports of equipment such as for electricity and rail transportation will be boosted, as well as the exports of complete sets of major equipment. Global competitiveness in newly emerging industries such as energy conservation and new energy will be further improved.
* Service sectors, such as finance and logistics, will be further opened up, and the proportion of services in foreign trade will be higher. 
Second, to improve the international competitiveness of foreign trade. 
* Modern technology will be used to transform traditional sectors and improve the quality of labor-intensive products. Transnational corporations and overseas scientific research institutions will be encouraged to set up research organizations in China. 
* Various means will be adopted to promote Chinese brands overseas. 
* Enterprises will be encouraged to operate and conduct quality tests in accordance with international standards.
* Businesses will be encouraged to use after-sales service as an important approach to explore global markets, and improve service quality. 
* The development of cross-border e-commerce will be greatly boosted.
* There will be greater promotion of free trade pilot zone across the nation while construction of the newly-established free trade zones in Guangdong province, Tianjin municipality and Fujian province will be advanced. 
Third, overall cooperation with countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road will be improved. 
* Exports of labor-intensive products to these countries will be continued amid their infrastructure construction, to drive the exports of complete sets of major equipment, technologies and services.
* Exports of industries and capacities over which China has advantages will be encouraged to “go global” for greater cooperation. Enterprises in highly technological sectors such as nuclear power and rail transportation are encouraged to make investment in these countries. 
* Cooperation in electric power transmission and optical cable communication will be expanded, to speed up the establishment of international trading routes that connect Central Asia, Russia, Mongolia, the Eurasia land bridge, Southeast Asia and South Asia.
Fourth, realizing international cooperation that brings benefits to all parties.
* A key task will be the early signing and implementation of free trade treaties with South Korea and Australia and to promote negotiations between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to upgrade their free trade deal. China will also work to carry forward free-trade negotiations under the framework of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which includes China, 10 ASEAN nations, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand, and free trade deals with Israel and Sri Lanka. China will also advance the construction of the free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region and launch free trade deal talks with other trading partners.

The Guidelines of Pushing the Construction of Eco-Civilization, a document the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued recently, are a timetable and roadmap to implement decisions made by the CPC to protect and improve the environment, said Xu Shaoshi, director of the National Development and Reform Commission in an interview with Xinhua News Agency. 
China’s development has reached the upper limit of the environment’s capacity, and the development of eco-civilization lags behind the development of the country’s socioeconomic development, said Xu, explaining why the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued the document. 
The document stresses that the country must develop in a sustainable way and ensure a clean environment, and that everyone, from the government, enterprises to individuals, should meet their responsibilities to protect the environment, said Xu. 
Among other requirements, the document stipulates that economic development and resource exploration must not excel the capacity of the environment, and that the country should set up a system as soon as possible where those who damage the environment compensate for the loss, those who benefit from environmental protection pay for it and those who protect the environment are reasonably rewarded. 
Also, cases of officials who cause serious damage to the environment as a result of irrational pursuit of economic development should be recorded, and the officials should be held accountable and should not be promoted, the document said. 
Four key words in the document: 

1 Green 

The document emphasizes the importance of green development, such as developing environmental-protection industries and new-energy technology and products. 
2 System 

The country should set up or improve a series of systems, including one to confirm the property rights to natural resources and make sure the resources are used for purposes that have been approved by the government. 
3 Notion 

The document makes clear that the government should promote the notion of green and efficient development as well as civilized and healthy ways of living. 
4 Pathways 

Specific principles and tasks were set for the country to observe and accomplish in order to make its development significantly more energy-saving and environmental-friendly by 2020. 
For example, the document says that the country should base its economy on green, recycling and low-carbon development.

By 2020, the quality of over 70 percent of the water in seven key river basins, such as the Yangtze River and Yellow River, will reach level III or above, and the amount of foul water in urban built-up areas will be controlled, thus not exceeding 10 percent. 
A list of ten measures will be adopted in order to realize the targets, according to the action plan:
1. The discharge of pollutants will be controlled and emission reduction measures will aim to tackle pollution caused by industries, urban living, agriculture and the rural sector, and ships and ports.
2. Economic restructuring and upgrading will be further boosted. Industrial water and reclaimed water and seawater will be used to promote cyclic development.
3. Measures will aim to continue saving and protecting water resources. A strict management system of water resources will be implemented so as to control the overall use of water, improve water-use efficiency, and protect the ecological flows of key rivers.

By the end of 2017, foul water in urban built-up areas will be basically eliminated.
9. The duties of all parties will be clarified and implemented. Local governments should be more responsible for the protection of the water environment and pollutant discharge units should be made accountable. The central government will check the implementation of the action plan in different basins, regions and sea areas every year.
10. Public participation and community supervision will be improved, and the government will regularly publish a list of cities and provinces that have the best and worst water environment.

			State Council urges better port facilities to support foreign trade






Updated:
Apr 17,2015 6:33 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued a circular on April 17 to improve government work on ports to further develop foreign trade.
The circular gave instructions to improve port work in five major areas: service, construction, cooperation, opening up and operating mechanisms.
First, service offered at ports should be optimized to ensure steady growth of foreign trade. More powers will be delegated to lower levels and more administrative approvals canceled in services related to exports, imports and customs clearance. 
On-the-spot law-enforcement work will be reduced to as little as possible to improve clearance efficiency. Inspection of cargo will be conducted in a nonintrusive manner and without leading to delays. Goods that attract fees will be published in a list. Intermediate service agents with government background that charge fees without providing practical services will be abolished. Advance paperwork clearance will be done online to raise the efficiency of tax rebate procedures.
Second, constructions at ports shall be strengthened to upgrade and transform foreign trade. By 2017, a “single window” service will be provided at all ports nationwide. A self-service system that allows tourists to file for clearance will be promoted in addition to a one-stop check system for vehicle inspections. Local governments are encouraged to build port-oriented economies that integrate processing, trading, logistics and tourism.
Third, cooperation among ports will be strengthened to improve the environment for foreign trade. The reform to integrate the customs clearance system nationwide will be pushed forward to build a unified workflow. A mechanism that deals with customs clearance procedures at ports across different administrative regions and government departments will be established at a faster pace.
Fourth, the opening up of ports should be pushed to a higher level. Inland ports should operate in accordance with the strategy of the Silk and Belt Initiative. The establishment of key ports along the Silk Road Economic Belt will be hastened. Several key clusters of ports with water and air connectivity and international competitiveness will be built in coastal areas. 
Fifth, mechanisms should be improved to raise ports’ capability to contribute to economic and social development. Supervision and analysis of traffic, clearance efficiency and development at ports should be enhanced to predict the volume of passengers and cargo in the medium and long term to provide the statistical basis for the opening up and optimization of ports. 
The time frame for different administrative procedures will be clarified in a streamlined supervision system at all ports to improve their efficiency. Relevant regulations and laws will be revised to build a better legal system for development of ports.

A plan to further reform and open the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone was issued by the State Council on April 20 in a key measure to further pave the way for the country’s comprehensive reform and opening up. 
The Shanghai free trade zone will help pioneer China’s reform and innovation development by implementing national strategies such as development of the Yangtze River Economic Zone, exploring new modes of regional economic cooperation, and creating a business environment under the rule of law, according to a statement issued along with the plan.
Management of the negative list will be improved to accelerate the transformation of government’s functions, the plan said.
In this regard the negative list will be promoted as the major mode of management for market access, a change from the previous administrative approval-oriented management. Lists that regulate the power and duties of the government will be drawn up and published, to further clarify the relationship between government and market. 
The plan requires a comprehensive supervision system that involves administrative regulation, industrial self-discipline and public participation.
Industry associations and professional service organizations are encouraged to take part in market supervision, it said, and efforts will be undertaken to explore the possibility of introducing third-party organizations to be involved in issues such as a review of enterprise information.
According to the plan, systems of investment management will be innovated to adapt to the deepening reform and opening up, and such efforts will include the further opening up of service and manufacturing industries.
Reforms will be conducted to facilitate the management of foreign and overseas investment. 
Pre-project filing will be a key ingredient in management of overseas investment projects, while an improved platform that facilitates overseas investment services will be set up. 
The plan also said that innovation regarding trade regulation and the financial system will be actively promoted, and legal and policy guarantees will be strengthened in the zone.

China is planning to boost development of the exhibition industry through market liberalization, according to a guideline released by the State Council on April 19.
A ministerial joint conference, including a dozen central government departments, will be established to coordinate the formulation and implementation of new market rules, the guideline said, setting a deadline of 2020 for China to have an exhibition center “with a sound development environment and a high level of internationalization”.
Licensing of economic and technological exhibitions will be gradually delegated to provincial-level commercial authorities, while the number of government-funded exhibitions will be reduced. In their place, private companies are encouraged to organize and sponsor such events, according to the plan.
It said China will guide big exhibition companies to acquire, merge with or buy stakes in foreign counterparts to establish multinationals.
Small exhibition firms will meanwhile enjoy tax breaks, and customs procedures will be streamlined to facilitate cross-border events.
The government plans to support exhibition-related sectors including transport, logistics, telecommunication, finance, tourism, catering and hotels.
China will “set up a cooperation mechanism” for domestic and foreign exhibition companies, and invite global giants to hold events in China, according to the plan.
It also said authorities will strengthen intellectual property rights protection, with rampant counterfeiting in China a big turnoff for international brands interesting in exhibiting here.
China is a latecomer to the exhibition business compared with developed countries, but it has become the world’s second-largest exhibition holder in terms of the number of events and venues.
Despite the achievements, the guideline noted that China’s exhibition market is far from mature, with weak global competitiveness and an absence of sound policies.

			Building teams of rural doctors






Updated:
Mar 23,2015 10:20 AM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council General Office on March 23 issued a document to solicit opinions on creating teams of rural doctors. 
The document focuses on practical problems facing rural doctors, and ways to deepen the medical and health system reform. 
It proposed to reform the service model and mechanism to promote motivation, enhance the supervision of healthcare services and improve policies related to subsidies, pension and training for rural doctors.
The document also proposed a main goal - within a decade, a new project will have trained a team of rural doctors who obtained qualifications from a secondary vocational school, or a higher level qualification, and will have licenses for the level of assistant doctors or above. 
Additionally, their benefits should be ensured, and a high-quality rural doctor team that can meet the local requirements should be established.
Specific measures in the document:
First: To clarify the function and duties of the team. Rural doctors are mainly responsible for providing public services and basic medical services to local residents. They also undertake other work commissioned by health and family planning departments. There should be at least one rural doctor for every one thousand people. 
Second: To enhance administration of licenses. The process for issuing licenses for the team should be strictly regulated, to strengthen the service quality supervision. Evaluations should also be carried out regularly. 
Third: To optimize the structure of qualifications. Nurture secondary and senior vocational school students, offering them free three-year courses, so as to meet the requirements of village clinics. Rural doctors can also attend medical schools to receive an academic education.
Outstanding students who qualify as doctors and assistant doctors can receive free training at provincial and municipal hospitals. 
Fourth: To make a medical career more attractive. Students who qualify as doctors and assistant doctors will be given priority for positions in village clinics. The authorities should also promote an integrated administration pilot project and offer further training.
Fifth: To change the service mode. Explore and establish services concerning rural doctors and local residents. Establish a licensed assistant general practitioner system in rural areas.
Sixth: To guarantee a decent income for the team. The newly added 5 yuan per person subsidy for basic public health services in 2014 and 2015 will be used as government purchasing services to assist rural doctors. Doctors working in remote and poor areas will receive more subsidies.
Seventh: To establish and improve elderly care policies.
Eighth: To improve the work environment and conditions for the team. Support construction of clinics and equipment purchase. Establish a risk management mechanism for rural doctors.

In a circular issued on March 25, the State Council agreed “in principle” on a general plan for the development of Ningbo from 2006 to 2020, which the Zhejiang Provincial Government recently revised and submitted.
Located on the south of the Yangtze River Delta, Ningbo is a port city in Zhejiang province, with a rich historical heritage. 
The State Council asked Zhejiang province to:
1. Continue improving the city’s competitiveness and its ability to develop sustainable growth.
2. Improve the balance between urban and rural development. 
3. Ensure Ningbo grows at a reasonable rate. By 2020, there should be a maximum of 3.95 million permanent residents in downtown Ningbo, and the area of land used to sustain urban development, such as land taken up by infrastructure and transportation, should not exceed 420 square kilometers.
4. Improve Ningbo’s infrastructure, including transportation, running water and sewage systems, garbage disposal and disaster-response. Zhejiang province should promote the integration of Ningbo and Zhoushan Port. It should also make sure the city has sufficient land for infrastructure.
5. Develop Ningbo into a more environmentally friendly city with a focus on energy conservation. The city should minimize pollutant discharge, improve efficiency in the treatment of sewage and garbage, and achieve all the goals concerning environmental protection set by the general plan.
6. Strengthen ecological environment protection and construction. Ningbo should enforce strict rules to protect the key ecological function areas in the city and ban the construction of new buildings on ecologically fragile land. It should establish a marine ecological protection system, minimize pollutant discharge in protected coastal areas, and keep the development of aquaculture industry at a reasonable level.
7. Enhance living conditions by providing public services, including health and education, according to the population estimate and projections of population distribution. It should also push forward affordable housing projects.

The State Council approved an application from Zhejiang province and the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) to set up a pilot zone for overseas e-commerce in Hangzhou, the province’s capital. 
In a written reply to the application issued on March 12, the State Council asked that the pilot zone should explore ways to improve various aspects of the country’s overseas e-commerce industry, including transactions, payments, logistics, customs clearance, tax refunds and foreign exchange settlements. 
The pilot zone should develop a system and rules that suit and lead e-commerce development around the world, and become such a leading example in overseas e-commerce that other regions in the country will be able to learn from it, the State Council said. 
Zhejiang provincial government should vigorously support the pilot zone, create a convenient commercial environment and ensure fair competition for companies in the zone, while guaranteeing national, cyber and transaction security as well as the quality of products. The provincial government was also asked to set up a system to record the pilot zone’s information, and apply for approval before issuing any major policy or taking on any major construction project for the pilot zone. 
The State Council also asked its departments to support the development of the zone, and that the Ministry of Commerce should follow and inspect the performance of the zone, and file reports to the State Council on major issues concerning the zone.

The State Council General Office issued a notice on Feb 9 to ensure safety of tourists during the 2015 Spring Festival and Lantern Festival.
It is estimated that there will be an increase in tourist numbers during the two festivals when many places hold elaborate activities, increasing safety risks due to temporary stalls and fireworks displays. The office asked related departments at every level to learn from the experience of the fatal New Year’s Eve stampede in Shanghai, and pay close attention to safety.
Concerned government departments above county level should take on the responsibility for supervision, and specify the responsibilities of related enterprises, sponsors, travel agencies and frontline staff. Serious safety violations caused by negligence or misconduct will be thoroughly investigated.
Grand open gatherings and celebrations require approval and departments and enterprises should make contingency plans to ensure safety. Tourist information should be released by ministries to help tourists avoid safety risks.
Ministries should supervise safety measures according to national laws and regulations; and local governments should enhance information sharing and coordinate action for response to any emergency.
Ministries such as tourism, public security, and industry and commerce should establish a comprehensive supervision mechanism to prevent illegal conduct. A mechanism dealing with tourists’ complaints should also be established.
Travel civility should be promoted by ministries in places such as transportation hubs, scenic spots, hotels, and tourist information centers to encourage orderly behavior and a good environment during the festivals.

			Guideline to boost entrepreneurship and innovation






Updated:
Mar 11,2015 3:43 PM
	    english.gov.cn












A guideline to promote mass entrepreneurship and innovation was released by the State Council on March 11.
The guideline was introduced to boost the development of “mass makerspace”, service platforms for entrepreneurship where innovators gather to create by sharing resources and knowledge, to nurture an environment for entrepreneurship and innovation as well as to allow people to realize their full potential.
The guideline stated goals to achieve by 2020. The goals include building mass makerspaces to meet the demands of startup entrepreneurs and to deliver professional services, to cultivate a group of angel investors and venture capital institutions to offer convenient financial support. It also highlights the key goal of incubating a large number of small and micro-businesses in emerging industries to boost economic growth.
In order to build a low-cost, convenient, all-factor and open mass innovation space, the experience of incubation platforms such as makerspaces, venture cafes and innovation factories will be analyzed, the guideline said.
Good working conditions, and a friendly, supportive, community will be provided to individual startups where they can share their information and resources, it said.
Stepping up policy support, the government will also simplify registration procedures and offer subsidies in areas such as rent, broadband fees and software to innovative businesses. 
Training courses will be carried out in universities and colleges to encourage students to start their own businesses and people with technical expertise will be encouraged, the guideline said, as this approach will create a significant number of jobs.
Emphasizing the government’s role in providing innovation support, subsidies, and improving access to finance for startup companies, the guideline also asked government bodies to hold activities to promote entrepreneurship such as competitions and nurture a culture suitable for mass innovation.
Being a significant channel for creating jobs, mass innovation and entrepreneurship is regarded as a new engine for future economic growth in China, the guideline said.

			Guidelines to improve lives of the disabled






Updated:
Feb 5,2015 4:19 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council released guidelines on Feb 5 to improve the well-being of disabled people:
* Governments at all levels should safeguard and improve the living condition of disabled people and ensure that they share the fruits of reform and development.
* While progress has been made in recent years, the adoption and implementation of accelerated disability-inclusive national development strategies need urgent action, as 12.3 million rural disabled residents still live in poverty and 2.6 million urban residents face great difficulty.
* As an integral part of building a moderately prosperous society, the government should strive to narrow the huge gap in per capita household income between urban and rural disabled people, and that gap with the national average.
* By 2020, the social security system for the disabled should be completed and the national social security system be further improved.
* Promoting the living condition of disabled people needs increased national effort and support.
* The government should establish a subsidy system, expand the pension scheme and medical insurance to disabled people. 
* To enable persons with disabilities attain and maintain maximum independence, capacity development efforts should be aimed at ensuring access to employment. This can be done by promoting access to inclusive education, skill development and vocational and entrepreneurial training. 
* Authorities should spare no effort to increase employment and income of the disabled. State-owned enterprises should set job quotas and the government will step forward to promote employment of rural disabled people and enhance supervision to protect the rights of disabled.
* Public medical services should try and reduce the probability of getting disabled due to genetic or environmental reasons. Data concerning persons with disabilities will be collected and shared.
* Social organizations and market mechanisms play a greater role in improving disabled people’s life. Charity should be the responsibility of the whole society and volunteers’ participation will help disabled people enjoy a better life. The government should increase spending on disabled rehabilitation, care and nursing.

In a circular issued on Feb 4, the State Council asked its departments to enhance administrative approval procedures, to create a fairer market environment, boost efficiency and reduce corruption. 
All departments that are responsible for administrative approvals should rigorously implement laws and regulations at every step of the procedure, the circular said. They should also fully disclose information regarding approvals, in accordance with the law, to meet applicants’ right to know. 
Procedures, generally, should be streamlined to make them less time consuming. 
Designated areas should be established to receive all applications, and departments should also set up online application systems, the circular said.
Receipts should be issued once applications are submitted. If the applicants failed to submit all materials required, or if the materials submitted did not come in the correct form, the department should inform them clearly about what exactly is required and how it should be presented.
Deadlines should also be set by departments for processing applications. 
Comprehensive guidance advice, covering the full range of applications, including conditions, requirements, estimated review time and fees, must also be issued by the departments.
Departments must also work out detailed working standards, and punish anyone who fails to meet them. 
All departments that deal with approvals should submit their guidance advice and working standards to the State Council’s office of administrative approval reform by the end of June. 
Departments should also enhance supervision on how officials are processing applications, especially whether they have fully disclosed relevant information to applicants, finished the procedures before the deadline or were guilty of any misconduct. A complaint hotline or email address must be set up.
The State Council asked its departments to establish an online platform for supervision and inquiries, so that information can be shared among various departments and between the central government and local authorities.

			China adopts new contingency plan for environmental emergencies 






Updated:
Feb 3,2015 6:02 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued a new contingency plan for environmental emergencies — caused by natural events or human activity that endangers the environment or human health — on Feb 3 to reduce damage to life, property and the environment. 
Replacing the 2005 plan, the new plan further details the responsibility of authorities, work flow in monitoring and reporting, response measures, damage repairs and general readiness to tackle environmental emergencies. 
Focusing on air, water and soil pollution incidents that occur suddenly and in unforeseen circumstances, and environmental events caused by either natural events or human activity, the new contingency plan also clarifies the situations it covers. 
Emergencies related to nuclear accidents, marine oil spills and ship pollution are not included in this new contingency plan and will be dealt with in other provisions. 
Commitments are given to improve environmental emergency response capabilities of all government bodies. 
On the national level, the Ministry of Environmental Protection is responsible for the daily supervision and management of major pollution incidents of a magnitude that require the direct, rapid and coordinated response, or the intervention of national authorities in addition to local, district or regional authorities. When the event is designated as extremely serious, the State Council will respond directly after it has been briefed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection. 
On the local or regional level, government environmental departments will take care of incidents of minor pollution. 
To predict the likelihood of occurrence or the seriousness and urgency of an environmental incident, a four-level ranking system will be introduced. The system will be detailed enough to serve as the foundation for creating appropriate and effective operational procedures that influence decision-making processes for agencies and other responders. 
Information concerning environmental emergencies should be shared with the public through all possible channels such as the Internet, radio and television while an incident is still in its initial phase. 
Due to the variety and complexities of environmental emergencies, the involvement, cooperation, expertise and resources of a number of government agencies, both at central or local level, will be required to form an efficient national environmental response mechanism. 
The mechanism will be multi-disciplinary and most likely multi-agency, as areas of responsibilities will be clarified among various responders while agreements, arrangements or memoranda of understanding, if applicable, be concluded.

			Transfer payment guideline to promote equal development






Updated:
Feb 2,2015 5:37 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council released a guideline on transfer payment - a redistribution of income in the market system - on Feb 2, in a bid to further support equal development - especially in China’s central and western areas.
The authorities said the current transfer payment mechanism falls short of the requirements of a modern fiscal and taxation system, and the country will thus implement a comprehensive, transparent and refined mechanism to ensure efficient fund use, and step up reforms of the system.
The plan - which will first aim to address urgent or widely recognized issues - will aim to learn from the experience of other countries, and practical problems will also be taken into consideration.
According to the guideline, the powers and expenditure responsibilities of government bodies will be clarified - in an effort to streamline administrative management. 
Areas such as national defense, foreign affairs, national security - and issues related to nationwide market rules - will be the responsibility of the central government. 
The transfer payment structure will be improved by raising the share of general transfer payment and strictly controlling special transfer payment. 
Additionally, local governments should plan - in a rational way - on how to use fiscal funds.
The government will allow the market to play a decisive role, and will gradually restrict special transfer payment in competitive businesses and industries, to maintain a fair environment for market competition.
Efficient management and strict supervision of the transfer payment system will be required to facilitate the distribution of funds and to improve efficiency.
The latest budget report issued by the National People’s Congress in 2014 said there had been an increase in transfer payments, with payments from the central to local governments growing at a steady pace. The funds mainly went to central and western regions, thus promoting equality of basic public services in different areas.

Leaders at the provincial level are responsible for food security in their jurisdiction, the State Council said in a guideline issued on Jan 22.
Every province, autonomous region and municipality should make sure the extent of farmland is above the minimum level required, and make sure the quality of the farmland doesn’t fall.
The National Development and Reform Commission and the State Administration of Grain should work with relevant departments to come up with a way to appraise how the authorities of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities fulfill their duties as required by the guideline.
According to the guideline:
* The authorities should speed up improvement in the quality of farmland by building better irrigation facilities and introducing water-saving technologies. 
* Provinces, autonomous regions or municipalities that rely on grains purchased from other regions should develop farmland that ensures a high and stable yield even during droughts or floods.
* To make the agricultural development sustainable, local authorities should develop water-saving or dry farming, and strictly curb damage to the environment, such as excessive use of fertilizer, pesticide or plastic film, and extracting groundwater faster than it can be replenished.
* Grain producers should get full subsidies in time. More subsidies should be provided for major grain producing areas, financial institutions should be encouraged to lend money to grain producers, and the agricultural insurance system should be improved.
* The authorities should renovate barns that need repair, and set up a network of grain purchase stations that will make it easier for farmers to sell their produce.
* Provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities should replenish their food reserves strictly in accordance with the scale and deadline set by the government. 
* The reform of State-owned grain companies should continue. The development of private grain companies and private food brokers should be supported, and grain companies should be encouraged to join the futures market to avoid risks. 
* The authorities should maintain stability in the food market. Measures include ensuring the safety of imported food, cracking down on food smuggling, setting up an emergency food supply system by the end of 2017 and cracking down on behavior that disrupts market order, such as hoarding, profiteering or adulteration.
* Regions where soil is degraded by severe pollution should carry out remediation, change the kinds of crops planted and mark land where farming is forbidden. There should be a sound system of standards to assess the quality of grains, as well as a supervision chain from farm-to-table to ensure food safety.
* The authorities should establish a mechanism to dispose of grains that contain excessive amount of pollutants and make sure they don’t enter the food market.
* Grain producers as well as local authorities, including county-level and township-level authorities, should be held accountable if they fail to ensure grain quality and safety.
* The authorities should also encourage people to save food and introduce new equipment and technology to reduce grain loss.

			China to speed up agri modernization through reforms, innovation 






Updated:
Feb 2,2015 6:27 AM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China will step up reforms and innovation to speed up agricultural modernization in 2015, according to a key policy document released by the Party and government on Feb 1.
As the Chinese economy, under the “new normal,” shifts from high-speed to medium-to-high-speed growth, it has become a key issue to continue consolidating the position of agriculture as the foundation of the economy and to further increase farmers’ income, said the document.
The “No 1 Central Document” refers to the first major policy document of each year released by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.
This is the 12th consecutive year in which the document has focused on agriculture and rural issues.
The document listed 5 aspects and 32 points for detailed government work on reforms and tasks related to the “three rural issues”, agriculture, rural areas and farmers.
The document highlighted the challenges facing China’ s agricultural sector, including surging production cost, shortage of agricultural resources, excessive exploitation and worsening pollution.
According to the document, China will strive to transform the development mode of agriculture, boost policies that benefit farmers, push forward the building of new socialist countryside, deepen rural reforms and strengthen rule of law in dealing with rural issues.
This year’s document put more emphasis on “strengthening reform and innovation,” compared to the one of 2014, Zhu Lizhi, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences told Xinhua.
China’s agricultural modernization is expected to be accelerated with the help of the new policy document, Zhu added.
Highlighting the role of agriculture, the document said a strong agricultural sector is the prerequisite of a strong China.
It urged accelerating the transformation of agricultural development mode.
Instead of mainly pursuing high output and relying on resources consumption, China should put equal emphasis on quantity, quality and benefits, and attach importance to competitiveness, technological innovation and sustainable growth, it said.
The document urged making the transition as quickly as possible.
The goal is to blaze a modern agriculture development path featuring high efficiency, product safety, resource saving and environment friendliness, said the document.
To transform the development mode, the document calls for deepening agricultural restructuring, raising the quality and safety levels of agricultural products, strengthening the role of science and technological innovation, and innovating the circulation patterns of farm produce.
China’s current way of cultivation has over-exploited the fertility of the farmland and the unsustainable mode is coming to an end, said Zhu.
The second major task is to boost farmers’ income.
China will increase investment in the agriculture sector and the countryside, boost the effectiveness of agricultural subsidy policies, improve the pricing mechanism for farm produce and enhance supporting services, said the document.
“These measures will further activate rural resources and help farmers to increase their income,” said Dang Guoying, a senior researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
The third task is to accelerate the building of new socialist countryside.
The government will boost rural infrastructure building, raise public service levels in rural areas, improve rural environment, and encourage more social capital investment in rural development.
The introduction of social capital will play an important role, said CASS researcher Li Guoxiang.
The fourth major task is to deepen rural reforms.
More efforts will be made to establish a new-style agricultural management system, accelerate reforms of rural collective property rights system, steadily push forward pilot reforms of rural land system, carry out rural financial system reforms, and deepen water conservancy and forestry reforms.
It urged guiding land management rights to flow in an orderly way and raising the scale of agricultural production.
Rural reforms will reinvigorate the countryside by awakening the “sleeping” resources like farmland and capital and making them flow in an orderly and reasonable manner, said Ye Xingqing, a researcher with the Development Research Center of the State Council.
Fifthly, The document calls for improving agricultural and rural legal system to strengthen the rule of law in dealing with issues such as protection of rural property rights, regulation of rural market and rural reforms.
The document for the first time noted the importance of rule of law and it is the strengthened rule of law that will ensure rural reforms be carried out smoothly, said Zheng Fengtian, an agriculture professor at Renmin University of China.

Four areas were highlighted by the State Council in a circular issued on Jan 13 to boost public health. 
Measures to protect and ensure public health are one of the key elements in improving living conditions, quality of life and the general welfare of the people, the circular said.
The first area highlighted a favorable environment and local governments and departments are required to take action to ensure this, especially in regard to safe drinking water. A regulatory system is suggested to guarantee water safety at source, production and in supply. 
Access to rural toilet facilities was also discussed. The State Council aims to complete the construction of environmentally friendly household toilets in rural areas in all eastern and some mid-western provinces by 2020. All public toilet facilities in these areas should also be environmentally friendly. 
A monitoring system for diseases transmitted by insects will be established, especially to combat dengue and hemorrhagic fever. 
Health education should be strengthened. It is of crucial importance that the public take part in fitness activities and be aware of the benefits of exercise, the circular said. It also suggested restrictions on tobacco sales and a total smoking ban in public areas. 
Comprehensive public health management was also discussed. The State Council will introduce a sanitation assessment system for targeted cities and counties by 2020. Health inspections will continue to be carried out during the urbanization process.
An innovative approach and various measures were essential to ensure public health, the circular said, as well as to control the risk of spreading diseases, boost public health management and motivate people to adopt healthier habits and reduce the risk of contracting illnesses.

			New regulations open legal doors for environmental NGOs



		Zheng Jinran 


Updated:
Jan 8,2015 11:09 AM
	    China Daily












Environmental NGOs will get stronger legal support and greater power to sue companies and individuals who violate the revised Environmental Protection Law, as part of a national campaign to curb air pollution, said the country’s top court. 
A judicial interpretation on the handling of civil environmental cases involving public-interest litigation, released by The Supreme People’s Court, took effect on Jan 7. 
“Under the previous regulations, many environmental cases were rejected by the courts because of stringent requirements on NGOS to prove they were legally recognized, so the new rules are expected to solve this problem,” Sun Jungong, the court’s top spokesman, said on Jan 6. 
Under the judicial interpretation, social associations, groups, and foundations that have had no administrative or criminal punishments in the past five years will be allowed to lodge public-interest lawsuits relating to the environment. 
“The social organizations can now prove their lack of a criminal record with their official seals, making it easier for them to apply to the authorities for proof of that fact, which will greatly facilitate the participation of NGOs in lawsuits,” Wang Canfa, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, said. 
Criminal records should be related to the NGO’s main sphere of activity, so irrelevant crimes such as traffic offenses will not be included, Wang explained. 
In addition, environmental organizations that successfully bring cases against polluters will be able to force the defendants to pay all the legal fees, “which will ease their financial burden”, Wang said. 
The judicial interpretation lowers identity thresholds for NGOs in the field of environmental protection, allowing a greater number of them to file lawsuits. The NGOS will also be allowed to sue companies or individuals across China, irrespective of where they are registered. 
Many environmental NGOs have voiced their support, and they expect the new judicial interpretation and the Environmental Protection Law to play a larger role in curbing air pollution. 
On Jan 1, the day the new law came into effect, the Nanping Intermediate People’s Court in Fujian province accepted a public-interest case against individuals accused of damaging the city’s environment. It will be the first case of its kind to be heard under the revised Environmental Protection Law, which took effect on Jan 8. 
Between 2008 and 2010, unauthorized quarrying took place on a mountain in Nanping. Waste soil and stones were illegally dumped, severely damaging the local environment. 
Two NGOs filed a lawsuit to force those responsible to clean up area around the quarry and help restore damaged vegetation. 
“Cases involving damage to the environment were hard to bring before the new law came into effect, because the previous regulation only focused on issues of environmental pollution,” said Liu Xiang, a lawyer representing the NGO Friends of Nature, which is based in Beijing and is one of the two organizations in the Fujian case. 
With the detailed interpretation from the top court and stronger legal support, Liu was confident of a smooth investigation and hearing, and said the case would be heard within six months. 
China has witnessed rapid economic growth in the past decade, but that has caused severe environmental pollution, especially clouds of polluted air that frequently shroud cities. 
A number of supplementary regulations and policies will also be enacted soon to curb pollution, Zhai Qing, deputy minister of environmental protection, said on Dec 30. 
The ministry has formulated 54 policies to support implementation of the new law. Five regulations covering the release of information and daily fines for pollution were released in 2014.

The State Council General Office issued a circular on Jan 21, unveiling plans to better utilize unused government funds.
The office said central government departments and local governments should transfer any unspent money from the 2012 fiscal year, or earlier, to new budgets.
The goal is to “ensure the proactive fiscal policy is better functioning” and improve the utilization of funds, the circular said.
According to a pilot plan starting this year, three-year rolling budgets will be made in sectors such as compulsory education, healthcare and environmental protection to regulate programs under planning, the circular said.
Preparations should be in place after the programs are listed in the three-year rolling budgets to make sure “the money comes into use immediately” upon its being transferred to the account, the  circular said.
It also vowed to intensify crackdowns on violations such as embezzlement of state revenue.

			China promotes the development of emergency services sector






Updated:
Dec 25,2014 5:53 PM
	    english.gov.cn












China will boost the development of the emergency services sector amid a serious and complex public security situation.
The comments were made in a statement released by the State Council on Dec 24.
The emergency services sector — which involves products and services aimed at preventing and managing emergencies — has played a vital role in tackling such incidents in recent years, the statement said.
The country’s efforts to promote the development of the sector will also help to optimize the industrial structure. 
And this is also part of China’s efforts to foster the new drivers of new economic growth — so as to invigorate its economy.
China’s emergency services sector is at an early stage, and some key technological products still rely on imports. 
It is necessary to speed up its development so that China’s emergency response equipment can be competitive in the global market, the statement said.
The State Council decided that, by 2020: 
China’s emergency services sector will witness growth in the expansion of its scale, and an emergency industry system will be basically formed;
China’s ability to research and develop key technologies and equipment related to emergency services will reach an advanced international level — and major equipment will be put into use; 
some large enterprises will be established and compete in the global market, while some small- and medium-sized companies will also focus on the emergency services sector; 
the conditions for the development of emergency services will be improved, and an innovative mechanism will be established to support emergency management.
According to the statement, the development of emergency services sector will focus on products concerning monitoring and early warning, prevention and protection, management and rescue, as well as services before and after the emergencies. 
To achieve these goals, the government will further regulate the standards of the emergency services sector, support its development with preferential policies — concerning taxation, investment and financing — cultivate qualified personnel to meet the requirements of the sector, and create a better environment for the sector’s development by improving laws and regulations.
The State Council decided to establish a coordination mechanism — led by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, National Development and Reform Commission, and Ministry of Science and Technology — to develop the sector and address major issues. 　
The statement said all governments and departments are required to prioritize the development of the sector and confirm that policies and measures are implemented.

			State Council approves Urumqi’s overall urban planning






Updated:
Nov 26,2014 6:46 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued on Nov 25 a circular that approved and provided further guidance to the overall urban planning blueprint of Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. 
The State Council accepted the Urumqi Urban Master Plan (2014-2020) in principle, and urged the local government to make the city one of the country’s open gateways to the west.
According to the circular: 
* All construction-related activity within the 13,783 square-kilometer area subject to the city’s urban planning should be in line with the Plan.
* Urumqi should strengthen the unified planning and management of all industrial parks and zones, and promote the integration of the city with Changji. 
* The local government should enhance communication and cooperation with the 12th Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.
* Particular attention should be paid to townships and regimental farms with good infrastructure and potential for development.
* The size of the city should be reasonable. By the end of 2020, the population of central districts should not exceed 4 million, while land for urban construction should be no more than 519 sq km.
* Any attempt to set up new development zones or districts outside the area under the Plan is prohibited. Arable land, especially capital farmland, should be protected.
* The city’s infrastructure should be further improved with roads and railways built at a faster pace to better connect the city with the surrounding regions. Underground projects for water supplies, drainage, sewage and garbage disposal will be given high priority. Disaster prevention, monitoring and warning systems should be further improved.
* Green energy like solar and wind power will be promoted in the city, along with energy saving technologies in industry, transportation and construction. All environmental protection targets set in the Plan should be reached before deadline.
* The city’s affordable housing projects will be included in the immediate plan to ensure supply and funding. The old city will be upgraded steadily based on the residents’ needs and conditions. 
* Historical and cultural heritage in the city should be protected to preserve local traditions and national characteristics during the urban upgrade.
* The Urumqi government should faithfully implement the Plan. No institution or individual is allowed to make any change without permission.

			China gets tough on environmental protection






Updated:
Nov 27,2014 3:26 PM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — Environmental law enforcement is about to get tougher in China, according to a circular on Nov 27.
The State Council General Office outlined arrangements for a nationwide environmental protection campaign, promising a “war” against pollution in “every corner” of the land.
Law enforcement officers must be transparent in executing their duties and show “zero tolerance”. Illegal tipping of hazardous waste in particular must be severely punished. Those who break the law will be “blacklisted” and their identities made public.
Breaches of environmental regulations are frequent in China, however, “many cases are discovered, but few are punished,” said a member of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress last month. Despite this appearance, the number of criminal pollution cases last year exceeded the total number of similar cases over the last decade, according to the Environmental Protection Ministry.
Supervisors in the environmental ministry will oversee local government environmental protection, said Cao Liping, a ministry official.
Environmental issues have given rise to some mass incidents in recent years with residents angry at local authorities who they perceive to be damaging the environment and endangering public health with new construction projects.
Thousands of people gathered in the city of Shifang in southwest China’s Sichuan province in July 2012 to demand the local government halt construction of a copper-smelting plant. The project was duly scrapped.
Since 2007, paraxylene (PX) projects planned in eastern Xiamen, northeastern Dalian, and southwestern Kunming have been halted after residents complained.
Cao said that while the public are more willing to participate in environmental affairs, there is a lack of understanding between the government and the public.
Government/resident communication should be improved and it should be easier for the public to express their concerns. Citizens and social groups will be invited to participate in environmental law enforcement, he said.

			China facilitates domestic commerce, logistics development






Updated:

	    Xinhua












BEIJING — The State Council, China’s cabinet, on Nov 15 released guidelines to promote the development of domestic commerce and logistics sectors in an effort to speed up job creation and consumption.
Loans from commercial banks and other policy support will be given to relevant enterprises to build some of them into globally competitive retailers, wholesaler and logistics companies, noted the guidelines.
Efforts will be made by the authorities to improve business environment for these companies including reducing administrative approval procedures and tax burdens for them, it said.
From January to September, consumption contributed to 48.5 percent of China’s economic growth, outdoing investment, which accounted for 41.5 percent. However, some bottlenecks need to be unblocked to boost consumption in the world’s second largest economy.
It is very urgent to establish a highly efficient logistics and distribution system to meet the needs of the e-commerce and information era, Vice-Minister of Commerce Fang Aiqing said at a recent industry meeting.
The authorities will publish a blacklist of companies that fail to keep their promises in a bid to establish a credit evaluation mechanism, noted the document.
The State Council urges local governments at various levels to implement these measures in an earnest manner.

			China eases market access to boost investment in key sectors






Updated:

BEIJING — China will further ease market access to key industries in a bid to spur investment through innovating financing and investment regimes, the State Council announced on Nov 26.
The move aims to fully mobilize social investment, maintaining the pivotal role of investment in stabilizing economic growth, according to a guideline released by the State Council, the cabinet.
The easing in market access should further break industrial monopolies, reduce market barriers, and lower the access threshold, the guideline said.
Sectors specified included ecological and environmental protection, agriculture, water projects, municipal infrastructure, transport, energy infrastructure and grid construction, telecommunications, as well as public services such as elder care, sports and cultural facilities.
To facilitate easier access to these industries, the government will promote public-private partnerships, and provide financial incentives such as subsidies and subsidized loans for investors.
Meanwhile, the government will also innovate credit services, deepen rural finance reforms, encourage the development of equity investment funds and venture capital funds.

BEIJING — The State Council on Nov 21 urged for the further development of the nation’s state-level technological and economic zones, through openness, innovation and modernization.
Guidelines, released by the cabinet on Nov 21, said that zones should redefine their development strategies to cope with the changing global environment.
The aim is that modernization and innovation will result in these zones becoming important platforms that lead regional economic development, and the paragons of innovation-driven and environment-friendly growth.
In addition, the guidelines urged the zones to initiate open economic regimes and opportunities for foreign investment.
Local authorities will need to play a part too, the cabinet said, through the drafting of specific plans and policies to support the restructuring and improvement of zones.
Such zones were established in the 1980s and were part of efforts to expand opening up. By June this year, there were over 200 across the country.

BEIJING — China unveiled a three-year reconstruction plan for a quake zone in southwest Yunnan on Nov 23, promising to improve living conditions and economic development.
The reconstruction plan was adopted at an executive meeting of the State Council on Oct 24, two months after a 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck Ludian county on Aug 3.
The earthquake killed more than 600 people and destroyed about 80,000 homes.
The plan aims to address housing, public management, infrastructure, the natural environment and industry affected by the natural disaster with more capital support and less taxes and dues.
The top priority will be people’s livelihoods, according to the plan.
The Yunnan provincial government will shoulder major responsibility in the reconstruction work, with assistance from the central government, according to the plan.
Also on Nov 23, the State Council issued policy guidelines to support reconstruction work in the Ludian quake zone.
The guidelines proposed nine support measures, including reconstruction funds, credit support, employment assistance, material supplies and poverty relief.

			Ministry of Science and Technology’s guidelines on scientific and technical reporting system



		Chen Mengwei


Updated:
Sep 11,2014 5:08 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council General Office recently issued guidelines from the Ministry of Science and Technology on accelerating the establishment of a national scientific and technical reporting system, in a bid to promote the completion of archiving, open sharing, transformation and application of scientific and technical achievements. 
The guidelines require that researchers working on fiscal funded projects must submit scientific and technical reports. The administrative departments of science and technology, authorities in charge of projects - and those carrying out the projects - should assume their responsibilities, establish and improve the management of the national scientific and technical reporting mechanism and open sharing system, and gradually improve the relevant policies, standards and norms, so as to establish a unified national scientific reporting system.
The guidelines consist of 13 principles, including:
The coordinated management of the national scientific and technical reporting system should be strengthened. The Ministry of Science and Technology should focus on the overall planning, organization and coordination, supervision and inspection of the reporting system, including setting up relevant policies, standards and systems, and offering professional guidance to local governments and central departments. 
The responsibilities of each management body should be clearly stated. 
All local governments and relevant departments should make sure that it is clearly stated in research contracts that those responsible for projects are required to submit scientific reports that meet specific standards. The management of scientific and technical reports should be assigned to established institutions, and non-classified and declassified reports should be regularly submitted to the Ministry of Science and Technology. Those responsible for projects should establish a reporting mechanism, organize researchers to complete reports as required by their contracts - and promptly submit them to the project authorities. 
The archiving and collection process related to the scientific and technical reports should be improved. 
Local governments and departments should aim to collect reports concerning completed scientific and technical projects. Researchers working on projects sponsored by social capital are encouraged to submit their reports to the Ministry of Science and Technology or its delegate agencies through the national scientific and technical reporting services system. The Ministry of Science and its delegate agencies are in charge of the processing, collection and management of all the reports. 
Additionally, a sharing mechanism concerning the reports should be established. 
The Ministry of Science and Technology should provide an open sharing service to the authorities in charge of projects and those who carry out the projects, researchers - and also the public - via the national scientific and technical reporting service system. The Ministry of Science and Technology and the authorities in charge of the projects should focus on ensuring security and confidentiality and the protection of intellectual property in sharing services, so as to protect the rights and interests of researchers and those carrying out the projects. 
An incentive mechanism should be established. Also, projects that are carried out without accompanying reports will not be accepted - and they will be considered incomplete. Regarding incidents of plagiarism, falsification of data and other academic misconduct related to scientific reports - the incidents will be clearly stated in the professional files of the researchers who break the rules, and will be made public in accordance with relevant regulations. 
A good environment for scientific and technical reporting should be created. Training in such reporting should be organized to assist researchers, and to standardize the management of the reports by supervising departments and research institutes.

			Regions given deadline for establishing emissions trading






Updated:
Aug 25,2014 2:05 PM
	    Xinhua












The State Council has published a guideline to promote the purchase and trading of emissions permits in regions piloting the scheme.
The pilot regions must establish mechanisms for the purchase and trading of emissions rights by 2017 to lay a foundation for the scheme to be rolled out nationwide, said a statement posted on the government’s website on Aug 25.
The pilots began in 2007 in 11 regions including Tianjin, Hebei and Inner Mongolia.
The regions can apply the permits to the pollutants that affect them the most, and revenues from authorizing emissions rights should be turned in to local governments to fight pollution.
Trading of emissions rights must be done in a voluntary, fair and environment-oriented way and trading prices will be decided by the buyer and the seller, the statement said.
Emissions rights, or permits, are key in emissions trading, a market-based approach to control pollution by providing economic incentives to reduce emissions of pollutants.
A firm gets an authorized limit on the amount of a pollutant that may be emitted. In China, the limit will be sold to firms in the form of emissions rights which represent the right to emit a specific volume of the specified pollutant.
Firms that need to discharge more must buy permits from those which need fewer permits. The transfer of the permits is referred as a trade. In effect, the buyer is paying for polluting more than permitted, while the seller is being rewarded for fewer emissions.
The pilots aim to allow the market to play a decisive role in resources allocation, encourage firms to actively cut pollutant discharges, speed up industrial restructuring and clean the environment, the statement said.

			China approves plan to combat climate change






Updated:
Sep 19,2014 3:02 PM
	    Xinhua












The Chinese central government on Sept 19 approved a plan that maps out major climate change goals to be accomplished by 2020.
The State Council, or China’s cabinet, green-lighted the plan, which was proposed by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). A statement released on the State Council’s website urged the NDRC to carry out their plan.
China has pledged to reduce its carbon emission intensity, namely emission for per unit of GDP, by 40 percent to 45 percent by 2020 from the 2005 level. It also aims to bring the proportion of non-fossil fuels to about 15 percent of its total primary energy consumption.
Other targets include increasing forest coverage by 40 million hectares by 2020.
The government will also speed up efforts to establish a carbon emission permit market, according to the plan.
The plan also called on deepened international exchanges and cooperation under the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”, the principle of equity, and the principle of respective capability.
The State Council said in its comment local governments and departments at all levels should recognize the significance and urgency in dealing with climate change and give higher priority to climate change actions.
