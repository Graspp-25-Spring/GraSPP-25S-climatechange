Meanwhile, Shanxi government was encouraged to implement the “Made in China 2025” strategy, develop emerging industries and advanced products in information technology, new energy vehicles, aerospace and biological medicine, and other fields, and build a green manufacturing system, targeted at transforming traditional industry in a green and ecological way. 
The plan urged strengthening coordinated innovation in Shanxi province, supporting the construction of national demonstration bases in mass entrepreneurship and innovation, and promoting the innovative development of an economic development zone in the region. 
The government also was urged to mull over plans to rejuvenate State-owned enterprises, expand mixed ownership reform in more State-owned enterprises, and promote the healthy development of the private economy.

			China to promote foreign investment growth 






Updated:
Aug 17,2017 7:43 AM
	    Xinhua












The State Council, China’s cabinet, on Aug 16 made public a series of measures for ensuring the steady growth of foreign investment.
China should make its foreign investment environment “more law-based, internationalized and convenient” to promote growth and raise the quality of foreign investment, according to a document from the State Council.
“The country should continue to reduce market access restrictions for foreign capital,” the document said.
It will roll out nationwide a negative list for foreign investment that has been tested in pilot free-trade zones as soon as possible.
China will expand market access to allow foreign capital to enter sectors including new-energy vehicle manufacturing, ship design, aircraft maintenance and railway passenger transportation, the document said.
On July 28, China began to implement a revised foreign investment catalogue, which included a negative list as well as sectors and industries in which the government wants to encourage foreign companies to invest.
The government will also make fiscal and taxation support policies to encourage overseas investors to expand investment and make use of their role in optimizing the service trade structure, the document said.
China encourages multinationals to set up regional headquarters in the country and wants more investment into western areas and old northeastern industrial bases.
The investment environment in national-level development zones will be improved by giving the zones more authority in investment management and raising their ability to provide industrial services, the document said.
Foreigners will find it easier to get work permits as the government aims to facilitate the cross-border flow of professionals.
Before the end of this year, China will release detailed new rules for granting visas to foreign professionals including extending the validity period, the document said.
Efforts should also be stepped up to improve foreign capital-related laws, provide better services to overseas investors and ensure the free outward remittance of their profits.
China will improve the protection of intellectual property rights, raise the competitiveness of the research and development environment and maintain continuity of foreign investment policies, according to the document.
The State Council also assigned the tasks to various government departments, including the top economic planner, the central bank, the customs authority and several ministries.
The document came as foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow dropped slightly 1.2 percent year on year in the first seven months of this year, data from the Ministry of Commerce showed on Aug 15.
The drop is not as bad as it looks due to high comparison base.
A report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said that China received $139 billion of FDI in 2016, third in the world behind the United States and Britain.
“With China’s large market and improving business environment, we are confident of maintaining a relatively high level of foreign investment inflow in the future,” said Commerce Minister Zhong Shan.
In the same period, high-tech manufacturing saw FDI rise 8.3 percent and foreign investment in high-tech services surged 16.8 percent. The number of new foreign companies rose 12 percent.

			Action plan to phase out waste imports 






Updated:
Jul 27,2017 8:43 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has approved an action plan to ban trash imports and reform the solid waste import management system to protect the environment and improve people’s health.
The circular set a target of comprehensively banning imports of solid waste that cause serious pollution by the end of 2017. Imports of solid waste that can be substituted by domestic resources would be gradually phased out by the end of 2019.
The catalog of imported solid waste should be adjusted before the end of July, while a ban on importing items such as waste plastics, unsorted scrap paper and discarded textile materials should be in place before the end of this year.
The circular suggests a gradual decrease in the types and quantity of imported solid waste, lifting the import threshold and improving related policies and mechanisms.
Also by the end of this year, the import licensing system for solid waste should be improved and import agents should be prohibited.
The circular urged the related ministries and departments to continue cracking down on smuggling of dangerous trash, medical waste, electronic waste and household garbage.
Efforts should be made to strengthen supervision, including investigating solid waste import application, reducing approvals of import licenses, and controlling the amount of waste. Special campaigns should be launched to overhaul the distributing centers for storing, disposing and utilizing solid waste.
The circular asked enterprises to take more responsibility and called for efforts to establish an international cooperation mechanism and to explore new methods of waste recycling.
The aim is to increase the amount of recycled domestic solid waste from 246 million metric tons in 2015 to 350 million tons by 2020.
Solid waste processing industries should be regulated and research and development of solid waste utilization should be strengthened, the circular stated.

Updated:
Jul 20,2017 7:52 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has issued a guideline on developing artificial intelligence (AI), setting a goal of becoming a global innovation center in this field by 2030. 
The total output value of artificial intelligence industries should surpass 1 trillion yuan ($147.80 billion). A mature theory and technology system should be formed.
Developing AI is a “complicated and systematic project” according to the guideline. An open and coordinated AI innovation system should be constructed to develop not only the technology, but also products and market. 
AI in China should be used to promote the country’s technology, economy, social welfare, maintain national security, and contribute to the world.
Breakthroughs should be made in basic theories of AI, such as big data intelligence, multimedia aware computing, human-machine hybrid intelligence, swarm intelligence and automated decision-making. Advanced theories which can potentially transform AI should also be looked at, including advanced machine learning, brain-like computing and quantum intelligent computing. 
Trans-boundary research should be promoted to connect AI with other subjects, such as cognitive science, psychology, mathematics and economics.
A common technology system should be developed based on algorithms, data and hardware. Technologies in the system include a computational knowledge engine, swarm computing, virtual reality modeling and natural language processing.
Innovation platforms should be constructed, such as an open-source computing platform, which can promote coordination among different hardware, software and clouds.
More AI professionals and scientists should be trained. 
The AI economy should be promoted. New industries using AI technology should be developed, such as smart robot, smart vehicle, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and smart terminal. Traditional industries should be integrated with AI to develop smart manufacturing, agriculture, finance, logistics and business.
Along with AI, the sharing economy is expected to grow and customized products will become the new consumption trend. Collaboration between humans and machines will become a mainstream production and service mode.
Enterprises are urged to apply AI in their design, production, management, logistics and marketing. Smart factories should be promoted.
AI should be applied in the public service and social management to build a safer, more comfortable and convenient society. Smart education, healthcare and elder care should be promoted. AI should also be applied in public administration, court, urban management, transportation, environmental protection and public security. 
AI should be applied in national defense, including military command, equipment and drills. 
In addition, a smart infrastructure system should be built, especially in mobile communication, internet of things, and energy. 
According to the guideline, the government will invest in qualified AI projects. Private capital investment is also encouraged. A development fund for AI should be set up.
Domestic AI companies and researchers are encouraged to cooperate with leading foreign AI teams and consider merging or investing in foreign companies, setting up joint research centers and AI international organizations.
Laws and regulations about AI should be formulated, as well as ethic principles. 
Technology standards, an intellectual property rights system, and a supervision mechanism should also be enacted.

			China to further promote commercial pension insurance 






Updated:
Jul 4,2017 7:30 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council released a guideline to speed up the development of commercial pension insurance.
According to the guideline, commercial pension insurance, provided by commercial insurance institutions, is defined as insurance products and services that mainly serve an older age group with major functions, including pension risk control and old pension fund management.
The move is aimed at establishing a multi-level, old age security system, as a way to cope with the aging population and to improve people’s livelihoods.
Until 2020, commercial pension insurance will play a major role in the promotion of both individual and family commercial pension plans, as well as in the healthy development of elderly care service industries, so as to become a stable contributor to financial safety and economic growth. 
To achieve the target, the guideline required related industries and departments to supply diversified and individualized pension insurance products and services according to people’s demands.
Healthy development of elderly care service should be stepped up with a better risk control mechanism. To guarantee the safe management of pension insurance funds, it can be guided to invest in major national strategies, especially those affecting people’s wellbeing.
In addition, to ensure smooth implementation of the plan, related departments are urged to provide supportive policies while creating a favorable environment.

			State Council approves plan to further open up Beijing’s service sector






Updated:
Jul 11,2017 5:31 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has approved a program on further expanding Beijing’s service sector, according to its official reply to the program. 
The plan is aimed at further expanding the comprehensive pilot program to open up Beijing’s service sector that was approved by the State Council in May 2015, exploring new models of opening up the service sector, and improving the development of the modern service industry and service trade in Beijing.
More efforts will be made to expand supply-side structural reform in the service sector to increase the quality and efficiency of service supply, and promote system innovation to build an internationalized law-based business environment, in a bid to promote the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Xiongan New Area, and provide replicable experience for opening up the service sector across the nation. 
Major tasks and measures in market access, financial management, and business registration are listed in the plan.
New measures will be rolled out to relax market access for foreign investment in key areas of the service sector, including science and technology, culture and education, finance, tourism, and healthcare. 
Customs clearance and inspection procedures will be streamlined, innovative policies on cross-border e-commerce will be adopted, and the “single window system” (meaning that all export and import procedures can be done at one stop) for international cargo trade will be promoted to further facilitate the service trade.
The financial management system will be improved by promoting the cross-border use of renminbi, expanding the reform of foreign exchange management system, encouraging diversified financial institutions to operate in Beijing, and support the development of new types of service trade. 
Initiatives and social insurance for high-level foreign talent will be improved through measures such as reinforcing support for overseas talent in project application and financing service, optimizing the approval procedures for foreigners in starting technology businesses in Beijing, and launching multilingual and one-stop government and social service websites for foreign talent.
The supervision system and modes will be improved by strengthening risk prevention management, setting up a national platform for sharing credit information, and promoting the development of credit services.
The plan also stresses the coordinated development of key service industries in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. 
The State Council asked Beijing’s municipal government to strengthen organization and guidance in implementing the plan to make breakthroughs in easing market access and accelerating system reform in the service sector. 
The Ministry of Commerce will work with other departments to supervise and evaluate progress, and ensure reform and opening-up measures in the program are put into practice.

			China to enhance CPC leadership in cultural organizations






Updated:
May 12,2017 7:05 AM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — Central authorities have called for enhancement of cultural organizations by the Communist Party of China (CPC) leadership, according to a guideline released on May 11.
The guideline, issued by the general offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, pointed out that overall development of cultural organizations lacks vitality, with some organizations weak in CPC leadership or internal management, and some unclear about their responsibilities.
CPC leadership in cultural organizations should be strengthened and improved, and innovations should be made in management and operation systems to raise efficiency, the guideline stated.
The management system should be under the leadership of the CPC and supervised by the government. Different levels of the system should take different responsibilities and coordinate with each other, the guideline stated.
The system should have a clear structure, efficient services and proper management in order to better serve cultural institutions and workers.
“CPC leadership should be enhanced in political, ideological and organization aspects,” the guideline reads.
As a bridge that connects the Party and the government with the market and society, cultural organizations are responsible for delivering messages from the Party and the government and implementing their decisions.
According to the guideline, cultural organizations are welcome to participate in making regulations, industrial standards and criteria, in talent evaluation, and in providing consulting services.
Cultural organizations should promote entrepreneurship among the people and the transformation of the cultural industry. They should hold more activities such as training, seminars and expositions.
The guideline also said that self-discipline and credibility should be promoted among cultural organizations. Institutions of press, publication and media can set up morality committees, while internet cultural organizations are encouraged to do their part in cyberspace control and management.
The CPC leadership should cover and be fully displayed in all cultural organizations.
Improvement should be made in fiscal, auditing and asset management systems as well as websites sponsored by cultural organizations and other online media channels, according to the guideline.
Cultural organizations are banned from cooperation with overseas organizations or individuals that endanger national security and interests. Activities held by overseas organizations in China must be managed according to law.
Leaders and cadres of the Party are not allowed to hold posts in cultural organizations before retirement or establish cultural organizations without approval, the guideline stated.

			State Council approves plan for pilot free trade zone in Liaoning






Updated:

	    english.gov.cn












State Council has released a circular to guide the pilot free trade zone in Northeast China’s Liaoning province, in a bid to expand opening-up and revitalize the Northeast region.
According to the plan, the free trade zone will be built into a trade park with high-end industries, convenient investment and trade facilities, improved finance services, and highly efficient supervision methods within three to five years.
Covering an area of 119.89 square kilometers, the free trade zone contains three districts in the cities of Dalian, Shenyang and Yingkou. 
Industries such as advanced equipment manufacturing, recycling economy and shipping will be promoted in Dalian; modern service industries concerning financing and logistics and advanced equipment manufacturing such as motors and their components and aviation equipment will be mainly developed in Shenyang, and Yingkou will be mainly responsible for cross-border e-commerce, finance and emerging strategic industries such as new generation information technology.
To meet the goals, the circular urged expanding reform in administrative management system, building a more convenient business environment and improving the level of utility for foreign capital. Foreign investment will be treated the same as domestic enterprises, and a negative list will also be used. 
For outbound investment, the circular encouraged companies in the zone to “go global” with governmental efforts in improving policy support, service security and risk prevention systems.
To promote the transformation and upgrades in trade methods, the circular urged making international trade easier by improving the “single window” trade method and international trade service system.
Innovation and opening-up were needed in the finance field. It encouraged promoting the cross-border RMB conversion, further simplifying procedures for current accounts, improving the finance support for revitalizing the Northeast region and setting up and improving the prevention system for financial risks.
In addition, industrial structures in the Northeast region will also be readjusted. Reform of State-owned enterprises will be increased, and industrial upgrades and transformation will be promoted. Enterprises in the free trade zone will be encouraged to develop value-added services such as renting equipment, providing solutions and remote consultations.
The pilot zone also should help promote integration in the Northeast region. It should strengthen cooperation with other provinces in research and design, production and sales, logistics, talent exchanges and educational training.
Besides the internal cooperation, the pilot zone should also expand economic cooperation with regions in Northeast Asia. With its location advantage, the Liaoning pilot zone should increase international production capacity and equipment manufacturing cooperation with countries along the Belt and Road Initiative and the countries in Northeast Asia.
The circular also urged speeding up the construction of an international shipping center in Dalian, multiple transportation methods in Yingkou and cross-border rails in Shenyang.
To ensure the measures are implemented, the plan proposed several guarantee measures, including strengthening regulation support and providing preferential tax policies.

	    english.gov.cn












China will comprehensively expand reform and opening-up of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone in efforts to exert its pioneering role in the country’s new round of reforms, said a circular issued by the State Council on March 31.
The document lists 21 tasks and measures to promote reform and opening-up in the zone. The tasks are mainly concerned with five aspects — building a comprehensive reform pilot area combining opening-up and innovation, establishing a risk and pressure testing area of an open economy system, building a pioneering area in improving government administration, becoming a bridge tower serving the Belt and Road Initiative and market players, and a pilot zone with successes that can be replicated nationwide. 
The circular called for a more open and transparent market access model and more business registration reform in the zone.
Innovative efforts include establishing an international-level “single window” system for foreign trade to coordinate, simplify and standardize trade data, building safe and efficient new customs supervision models, running inspection and quarantine risk classification assessments, and starting a competitive regulation model for innovation industries. 
As an open economy testing area, the FTZ should open more service industries and high-end manufacturing to foreign investment, carry out new rules for trade facilitation, innovate cross-border services and trade management models, further opening-up and innovation in financing, and establishing free trade port areas.
To improve government administration in the zone, the document urged speeding up administration reform, increase supervision, and optimize government services featuring information interconnection and sharing. 
Serving the Belt and Road Initiative, the document urged the Shanghai pilot zone to align the Asia-Pacific and multi- and bilateral cooperation and links with ports along the 21st Century Marine Silk Road, strengthen its financing services and explore competitive offshore tax systems. 
The circular also required the FTZ to accumulate successes that can be replicated, especially in the fields of market access, trade facilitation and system innovation, to contribute to the country’s reform and opening-up.
According to the document, by 2020, the trade zone will become a world-class free trade park with free investment and trade, transparent rules, fair and efficient supervision and favorable environment.

			China issues five-year plan on transportation 






Updated:

	    english.gov.cn












A five-year plan to develop China’s modern transportation was issued by the State Council on Feb 28.
The circular listed major tasks that include improving transportation networks, enhancing smart transportation, promoting green transportation, and developing new business modes in transportation. 
By 2020, high-speed railways will reach 30,000 kilometers — compared with 19,000 in 2015 — covering over 80 percent of cities with more than one million permanent residents. Railways, expressways and civil airports are expected to cover cities with permanent populations of over 200,000. Expressway mileage is expected to reach 150,000 kilometers and the number of civic airports 260.
The plan called for improvements in transportation networks concerning high-speed railways, expressways, airports, waterways and oil and gas pipelines. It includes building 10 horizontal and 10 vertical comprehensive transport corridors that interconnect east and west China, and north and south China. Transport corridors in central, west and northeast China were also highlighted. 
Meanwhile, most villages should be connected to asphalt or concrete roads, said the document. And the maintenance of existing roads in rural areas should be strengthened and improved.
The Belt and Road Initiative is a keyword in future transportation. More international transport corridors should be built, connecting China with Europe, North Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Far East, according to the document. Construction of the modern Maritime Silk Road should also be accelerated, with its center in East China’s Fujian province. 
Transportation should be used to help urbanization and balanced development among regions, including the coordinated development among Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, and in the economic corridor along Yangtze River. 
Transportation should also be connected with poverty alleviation. More roads, railways, and shipping waterways should be built in poor regions, such as ethnic group regions and remote areas.
More urban subway networks should be built, covering cities with permanent residents of over 3 million.
Transport hubs should be improved in terms of their passenger and freight services. Postal service, express delivery and logistics should also be developed in efficiency and service quality.
Transportation enterprises are encouraged to go abroad, participating in the construction of overseas transport infrastructure and promoting the export of China-made transport equipment.
Cutting-edge technologies should be developed in various fields, such as high-speed railways, electric locomotives, maglev trains and passenger planes.
Smart transportation is emphasized in the document. Information technologies should be integrated with transportation, including cloud computing, big data, internet of things and mobile internet, in order to upgrade its service and management and administrative supervision.
Transportation should be developed in a greener way, said the document. Public transport should enjoy more support in cities. Old high-energy consumption autos and ships should be phased out and environment-friendly transportation should be encouraged, with more public support facilities such as charging stations being built.
New transport businesses are encouraged, according to the circular. Aviation industry should be promoted to connect with tourism, culture, and internet industry. Transportation should also be encouraged to cooperate with internet and logistics, to build an integral and smart logistics industry.
Administrative reform on transportation should be promoted. More red tape should be cut and simplified. Airspace management should be reformed. More low-altitude space should be open, according to the document. 
Market access and price mechanism on civil aviation and railways should be further eased for fair competition. Public-Private-Partnerships should be also promoted in transportation, the document added.

			China to improve government service in townships






Updated:

	    Xinhua












BEIJING — The central authorities have issued a document calling for improved public services at the township level.
The document was issued by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council.
Township governments should provide quality education in rural areas with suitable teaching environments, safe campuses and support for under privileged students, according to the document.
It called on township governments to offer better training and vocational opportunities to rural residents, and ensure basic social services for special groups including the disabled, migrant workers, and children living in poverty.

It stressed that ancient villages of great historical and cultural value should be properly protected and developed, adding that township governments should also improve their service in areas such as environmental protection, food safety and juvenile protection.
The document urged governments of county-level and above to provide financial support for infrastructure, public services and other social undertakings in townships, and to encourage loans and investment to small towns and villages.
Township government budgets and spending should be strictly regulated to fend off local debt risks and guarantee fiscal balance, it said.
The document also called for preferential policies for township officials, such as easier promotions and subsidies, to attract talent to work in townships.

			State Council issues plan to promote employment






Updated:
Feb 6,2017 5:00 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council on Feb 6 released the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) on employment, an overarching guideline to promote employment and entrepreneurship in China in the next five years.
According to the plan, more than 50 million jobs will be created by 2020, with reasonable rises in wages and urban registered unemployment rate below 5 percent. 
Meanwhile, efforts are urged to improve the entrepreneurial environment and human resource structure. Educated and skilled workers should account for a large share of the total work force.
The plan calls for a balanced growth of new and traditional sectors to drive employment, and policies should be in place to guide labor-intensive industries to move to central, western, and northeastern regions.
More efforts should be made to promote high-end equipment, new materials, electronic vehicles, and other new industries and business patterns, to expand job creation. 
At the same time, preferential policies should be offered to enterprises and industries that absorb a large amount of labor.
According to the plan, the nation will step up development of modern agriculture, forestry, and production to create more jobs for farmers. “Internet Plus agriculture” and other new industries in rural areas should be also encouraged.
The plan calls for efforts to develop labor-intensive industries in resource-exhausted cities, and more support policies for regions struggling in declining industries, to stabilize and increase employment.
Meanwhile, administration streamlining should be continued to optimize entrepreneurial environment, and inspire more people to start businesses, an important approach to creating jobs.
Policies should be in place to encourage scientific, education, and cultural experts to take the lead in entrepreneurship, and create favorable conditions for overseas high-end talent to work and start businesses in China. 
Services to support entrepreneurship should be strengthened, with more incubation hubs and entrepreneurial parks being built, to ensure more startups could survive and succeed in the market.
The plan also calls for more active policies to ensure employment of university graduates, migrant workers, as well as poverty-stricken families and disabled people.

			State Council issues plan to prevent chronic diseases






Updated:
Feb 14,2017 5:15 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has released a medium- to long-term plan (2017-2025) on the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.
The plan, based on the “Healthy China 2030” blueprint, is to help reduce people’s financial burden in medical expenses, improve the average life expectancy and boost their health.
By 2020, premature death between 30 to 70 years old caused by chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases and diabetes would be reduced 10 percent compared with 2015, and the number would be decreased 20 percent by 2025, according to the plan.
The number of people with a regular exercising habit is expected to reach 500 million, and the smoking rate among people over 15 years old would be held to 20 percent by 2025.
To reach the goals and expectations, several measures would be taken, according to the plan.
First is strengthening education to improve citizens’ health quality. Governments at all levels are urged to spread knowledge of prevention and treatment of chronic diseases, and advocate a healthy lifestyle.
Second is diagnosing diseases in the early stage and providing special care for high-risk groups. The plan asks related departments to provide intervention and guidance for the high-risk group of people over 35, add the examination of pulmonary function and bone mineral to the medical check list of people over 40, and encourage inoculations. 
Third is improving tiered medical services. The government will further promote family doctor services and involve people already suffering from chronic diseases, and establish a medical quality management and control platform to improve medical services.
Fourth is promoting the coordination of prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. The plan urges setting up chronic disease centers in qualified areas and prevention and treatment systems of traditional Chinese medicine. 
Fifth is providing policy support and reducing people’s burden in medical costs. Medical insurance and social aid policies will be improved, diversified health insurance services will be further developed and production and supply of medicines will be guaranteed.
Sixth is building a green living environment by improving the policy support. More strict smoking control policies would be enforced, and food safety and quality of drinking water would also be guaranteed, said the plan.
In addition, development of health service industries will get a boost, and scientific research and transformation of its results will be encouraged.
The State Council urges all related departments, such as the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, to implement their own responsibilities, to make sure the measures are put into effect.

			China to complete drawing ecological ‘red line’ by 2020 






Updated:
Feb 7,2017 7:49 PM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — The central authorities on Feb 7 issued a guideline on an ecological “red line” that will declare certain regions under mandatory and rigorous protection.
The document was jointly issued by the General Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, and the General Office of the State Council.
By the end of 2020, according to the document, China should have clearly defined the “red line.”

Given that China’s ecological environment remains fragile and the environmental safety situation is pretty grim, the ecological “red line” serves as both a “bottom line” and a “lifeline” in safeguarding national ecological safety, according to the document.
The “red line” strategy will cover regions with important ecological functions, including water and soil conservation, biodiversity maintenance as well as windbreak and sand-fixation, along with ecologically fragile regions which are prone to soil erosion, desertification and salinization.
The guidelines asked Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, as well as regions along the Yangtze River Economic Belt to draw up a “red line” for ecological protection by the end of 2017, while other areas should come up with a “red line” before the end of 2018.
By the end of 2020, the demarcation of the border and calibration of the regions should be completed and an ecological protection “red line” system will be basically established.
By 2030, the layout of the ecological protection “red line” will be further optimized, effectively implemented, the ecological function of the regions promoted, and national ecological safety guaranteed, according to the document.
The move aims to ensure protected regions will not be ecologically degraded, and their acreage will not be decreased.
“China started to explore the theory and methods of the ‘red line’ in 2012 and made a series of pilots programs,” said Lu Jun, deputy head of the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning.
China’s environmental protection still lags behind its economic status, and decades of breakneck growth have left the country saddled with problems such as smog and contaminated waterways and soil.
In one of its latest attempts to fight pollution, China appointed “river chiefs” nationwide in December.
China detained 720 people for environment-related crimes in 2016, according to the national environment work conference in January.
Through public tip-offs and random checks, inspectors looked into 33,000 cases and imposed fines totalling 440 million yuan (about $63.6 million) after central government inspections in several provinces and municipalities, including Beijing and Shanghai.
Last year, a total of 4.05 million high-emission vehicles were taken off the country’s roads.
Partly due to such efforts, Chinese cities reported less PM2.5 pollution in 2016, with the average density of PM2.5 in 338 cities falling by 6 percent. Meanwhile, days with good air quality rose 2.1 percent from a year ago.

The State Council has approved the overall plan (2006-2020) for Hengyang city, Central China’s Hunan province. 
Coordinated urban and rural development was urged in the designated area of 1,121 square kilometers, with extra attention to be paid to planning the city, county and major towns under its jurisdiction.
According to the plan, the Hengyang government will control the population of permanent urban residents to 1.7 million and limit urban construction land to 161 square kilometers. No new districts or development zones of any kind will be allowed outside of the approved area. 
Newly added construction land should be strictly controlled, and underground space should be explored and utilized. Efforts should also be made to improve the land usage rate and protect basic farmland.

Other city infrastructure, such as water supply and waste disposal systems, should be developed with a coordinated plan. Disaster prevention and reduction work should also be reinforced, the circular said. 
While strictly controlling the development of heavy-polluting industries, improvement should be made in sewage and waste treatment. 
The State Council called for the development of public services concerning education, medical care and municipal administration, and accelerating the renovation of shantytowns and dilapidated buildings to create a resident-friendly city. 
Efforts should also be made to protect historic culture and natural reserves, conduct ecological restoration and improve the environment, the document said.

			State Council issues guideline on development zones

	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has issued a guideline to promote the reform and innovative development of China’s development zones, aimed at improving their leading roles in opening-up and improving the investment environment.
It urged strengthening the overall arrangement of all types of development zones, speeding up their upgrades, adopting innovative mechanisms and improving the management systems and policy support.
The goal is to build the development zones into leading zones for industrial development, pilot zones for high-level business operations, integrated zones for mass entrepreneurship and innovation and pilot zones for open economy and system innovation, forming new engines for the country’s economic growth.
Based on the principles of reform and innovation and led by related plans, the State Council asked to innovate the business models of development zones, spur their vitality and improve the distribution format.
To optimize the format of development zones, they should focus on industrial development, becoming platforms for developing local manufacturing, high-end new technology and productive services, according to the guideline.
Adopting the improvement of the business environment as their top task, the development zones should strive to provide quality services, suitable support facilities and convenient resources to promote economic system reform and transfer government functions.
National zones, such as economic and technical development zones, high-tech industrial development zones and special customs surveillance zones, should play their leading roles by emphasizing advanced manufacturing, strategic new emerging industries and processing trade industries, the guideline said.
It also urged the development zones to actively adapt to international conventions to build themselves into industrial parks with global influences.
Provincial development zones should rely on local resources, integrate industrial elements, and improve the business environment to become regional economic growth poles, driving the upgrades in regional economy.
Coordinating the development zones in eastern, central and western China should also be emphasized, said the guideline. It urged efforts to upgrade the industries in eastern regions, improve the business environment of the central and western regions, and those in northeast regions.
To speed up the transformation and upgrades of development zones, the State Council also urged setting up technology research centers, engineer labs, national key labs and innovation platforms and centers in the qualified zones.
It encouraged development zones to take various measures, such as establishing makerspaces, science parks, enterprise incubators and introducing talent to create a better environment for mass entrepreneurship and innovation.
Optimizing the industrial structure is also an important task. Traditional industries in the development zones should step forward to medium- to high-end development through technological methods. More measures such as integrating information technology and manufacturing, creating more emerging industries, and developing productive services should also be utilized to build the development zones into world-class industry clusters.
Moreover, development zones should also be encouraged to attract foreign investments and undertake international industrial transfers.
Green development is also one important principle of the development zones, so low-carbon, recycling and intensive development are stressed in the guideline.
The State Council urged the government in all regions to set up a unified coordination mechanism for the development zones. It also asked local governments to delegate the economic management powers that can be delegated to the development zones.
Private capital and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models should be encouraged in the establishment of development zones to diversify its business models, according to the guideline.

The State Council has issued a five-year plan (2016-2020) for the development of ethnic minorities, including a goal to boost the economic growth rate in minority areas higher than the national average. 
Under the plan, the 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income of both rural and urban residents in minority areas should be doubled that in 2010. 
It also set 2020 targets on industrial value-added output, the urbanization rate, poverty alleviation, and export and import volumes. 
The plan suggests local governments adopt policies that address the needs of impoverished people living in extremely harsh conditions, in scarcely populated villages or in border villages which cannot be relocated. 
The circular also suggested various resources related to capital, skills, information and technology should be integrated. 
It also offered national support to backup the implementation of key projects for poverty alleviation, such as distinctive industries, labor service export, and relocation. 
It underlined efforts to strengthen the construction of key infrastructure related to transportation, tourism, water conservancy projects and education. 
It also called for residential facilities such as telecommunication, logistics, and public services be improved. 
The plan also supported efforts to cultivate and develop distinctive industries that minority areas have a competitive edge in, with a focus on constructing demonstration zones for mineral exploration and processing, as well as food and agricultural products. 
Moreover, it urged more promotion of national trade enterprises, traditional handicrafts, traditional medicine, and the Halal food industry. 
The plan said more efforts are required to promote a new type of people-centered urbanization that will grant rural people who live in cities more social welfare than offered now to city dwellers. 
The State Council also vowed to enhance education in minority areas, enhancing students’ proficiency in Mandarin, while preserving their ethnic languages. 
Meanwhile, it called for promoting employment-driven entrepreneurship, and improving the health care system.
The plan also acknowledged the importance of preserving culture, with efforts put in to develop media coverage on ethnic culture industry. 
In addition, measures have been proposed to promote environmental protection and pollution control. 
Minority areas are also urged to support all-round opening up, participating in the Belt and Road initiative, the construction of an international economic corridor. 
The plan hopes the development of ethnic minorities with a small population can be accelerated, focusing on the construction of basic infrastructure. 
Villages and towns with distinctive features should be preserved, according to the document. 
Related departments should focus on improving laws and regulations in minority areas, and enhancing governance through think tanks, cadre training, and bilingual talent training.
Finance, investment, and related policies should also be put in place to support the economic and social development of minority areas.

			State Council issues territorial planning (2016-2030)






Updated:
Feb 4,2017 7:52 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has published a territorial planning document, including general plans on the spatial development of land and marine territories, and resources and environmental protection lasting from 2016 to 2030. 
The plan was released amid growing difficulties China is facing in developing and protecting resources. In recent years, China’s dependence on foreign major resources has been climbing, which is risky as the world’s economic structure is changing.
At the same time, the ecological environment has seen more challenges, including a continued decline in water quality in some regions, air and land pollution, serious degeneration in ecosystem structure and function and frequent geologic hazards. 
With the fast development of urbanization, the mismatch between economic layout and population and resources is popping out, and agricultural land and ecological land are disappearing, according to the plan. 
The detailed planning is aimed at improving the spatial layout of the country’s territories, with coordinated development between urban and rural areas, matured infrastructure facilities and sustainable development mode. It is also dedicated to enhancing the country’s capability in developing and protecting marine territories, in an effort to strengthen national security. 
Starting from 2015, the plan explores an overall system of developing and protecting territories by 2030.

China is planning to further streamline government administration, improve regulations and reduce business transaction costs to create a favorable business environment for foreign investment.
In order to implement the plan, the government decided to further push forward its opening-up policy, with efforts to revise the Catalog for the Guidance of Industries for Foreign Investment, and further open the service, manufacturing and mining sectors. 
In addition, it encouraged foreign investment to take part in the implementation of China’s innovation-driven development strategy and upgrades in the manufacturing sector, and encouraged foreign talent to start businesses in China. 
The circular said the “Made-in-China 2025” initiative also applies to foreign-invested enterprises, while encouraging them to pour more investment in high-end, intelligent and green manufacturing. 
Foreign investment is also encouraged to take part in infrastructure construction in energy, transportation, water conservancy, and environmental protection through franchising. 
Meanwhile, the government called for creating a market environment of fair competition, which requires related departments to examine the business licenses and qualification applications of foreign-invested enterprises with the same standards and processing timetable as those for domestic-invested enterprises. 
Domestic and foreign-invested enterprises should also get equal access to participate in China’s standardization reform, to enhance the openness and transparency of the country’s investment environment. 
The intellectual property of foreign-invested enterprises should also be protected, according to the document. 
The circular also called for more efforts to attract foreign investment, allowing local governments to form favorable policies to support foreign-invested projects that can facilitate employment, economic development and technology innovation, and reduce the costs for the investment and operation of foreign-invested enterprises. 
The central, western and northeast regions will receive support to undertake industrial transformation of foreign investment. In addition, foreign-invested enterprises in supported industries in western regions will enjoy preferential tax policies. 
The National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce should coordinate with related departments to strengthen supervision to ensure the implementation of these measures for foreign investment.

The State Council on Jan 13 released a national plan on protection and application of intellectual property rights, which will be carried out during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020).
The move is aimed at improving the legal environment, enhance market value and strengthen comprehensive management of intellectual property rights in China. 
The plan contains several major indexes, including the number of patents for every 10,000 people, number of registered work nationwide and the public’s satisfaction degree in intellectual property protection. According to the circular, by 2020, the three indexes should reach 12, 2.2 million and 80 percent, respectively. 
Related departments are asked to strengthen the legal system for intellectual property, enhance the efficiency in protection, and improve its quality and market value while speeding up the construction of key intellectual property enterprises, cities and provinces and promoting industrial transformation upgrades, in an effort to achieve the targets. 
The legal system for intellectual property is underlined. Efforts should be made to establish patent law, copyright law and laws against illegal competition, and study protection rules under newly emerging fields such as e-commerce and Internet Plus.
To enhance the protection level, departments should put more emphasis on judicial, criminal and administrative protection and strengthen protection in different fields, including imports and exports, traditional cultural heritage, newly emerging fields and people’s lives, said the plan.
Related departments are also asked to establish a quality supervision mechanism for patent application, optimize trademark registration, build high-quality copyrights and push forward intellectual property work on the design of geographical marks, new biological breeds and integrated circuits, with the goal to improve the quality and market value of intellectual property.
The plan also urged boosting the GPS industry, improving the intellectual property layout of Chinese manufacturing and supporting the development of an intellectual property alliance.
In addition, to further ensure the successful implementation of the plan, the construction of an intellectual property public service system was also emphasized, including building service platforms, developing service industry clusters for intellectual property, and enhancing service supervision mechanism.
The document also emphasized talent training and cultivation for intellectual property development and intellectual property cultural construction.

			China issues five-year plan on public healthcare






Updated:
Jan 10,2017 8:03 PM
	    english.gov.cn












A five-year plan on public healthcare (2016-2020) was released by the State Council on Jan 10, setting the goal of raising the average life expectancy by one year in 2020 than that in 2015.
According to the plan, although China has made many achievements in the past five years, the country still faces many challenges, including an aging population, rising threat of chronic diseases and threat of environmental contamination and food safety. 
The plan vows to handle critical diseases more effectively, including chronic diseases, epidemics, mental diseases, parasitic diseases, endemics and occupational diseases. The premature death rate caused by major diseases — such as cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and cardia-cerebrovascular diseases — is expected to fall by 10 percent compared with 2015. 


The issue of hygiene is underlined, especially in rural areas. The plan urged the enhancement of sewage treatment in rural regions and the construction of more toilets. “Sanitary toilets should cover more than 85 percent of villages,” said the document.
Programs to promote health education, nutrition and tobacco control should be launched. The smoking rate among people over 15 years old is expected to be reduced to less than 25 percent. 
More public sports facilities should be built and open to everyone for little to no cost. The sports area per capita is expected to reach 1.8 square meters. 
The health of women, especially those who are pregnant, infants and teenagers, should be better protected, according to the plan. Death rates of pregnant women and infants are expected to be lower than 18 per 100 thousand and 7.5 per thousand, respectively, by 2020.
In addition, the health of elders as well as poor and disabled people is also highlighted. Government subsidies should be provided to eligible poor and disabled residents on their basic healthcare insurance.

In terms of family planning, the two-child policy will continue. The plan hopes to protect girls better by offering government subsidies to eligible girls’ families and cracking down on abortion based on gender choice. 
The government should give more support to grassroots clinics and general practitioners. Patients are encouraged to see a doctor in grassroots clinics first, in order to ease the pressure of crowded big hospitals. 
Traditional Chinese medicine should be supported, as well as research on cutting-edge medical science, especially the treatment of critical diseases and the development of new medicines. 
Government supervision on healthcare services should be enhanced, especially involving food and medicines. Over 300 national food safety standards will be put in place as well as the modification of several medicine standards.
The plan also pledges to promote health industries, encouraging private capital and social organizations to provide healthcare services and develop new medicines and medical facilities. Commercial insurance is also encouraged by the plan.

	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has approved the overall city plan (2014-2020) for Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Northwest China.
Coordinated urban and rural development was urged in the designated area of 13,783 square kilometers, with strengthened efforts for the unified planning and management of industrial zones within the area, to promote the integrated development of Urumqi and Changji Hui autonomous prefecture. 
The State Council also urged the importance of focusing on towns and villages with good infrastructural conditions and great potential, and improve the urban infrastructures and public service facilities to benefit these peripheral villages. 
According to the plan, the Urumqi government will control the population of permanent downtown residents within 4.1 million and limit urban construction land within 513 square kilometers. No new districts or development zones of any kind will be allowed beyond the approved area.
Newly added construction land should be strictly controlled, and underground space should be explored and utilized. Efforts should also be made to improve land usage rate and protect basic farmland.
Inter-city transportation around and within Urumqi should be further improved in accordance with green and low-carbon principles in mind.
Other city infrastructure, such as water supply and drain and waste disposal systems, should be developed with a coordinated plan. Disaster prevention and reduction work should also be reinforced, the circular said. 
The document also urged building a resource-saving and environment-friendly city, with efforts to promote clean energy and a circular economy. 
While strictly controlling the development of heavy-polluted and excessive industries, improvements should be made to sewage treatment and harmless garbage treatment. 
The State Council called for the development of public services concerning education, medical care and municipal administration and accelerating the renovation of shantytowns and dilapidated buildings to build a resident-friendly city. 
Efforts should also be made to protect historic culture and natural reserves, conduct ecological rehabilitation and improve the environment, the document added.

			China issues five-year plan to cut emissions






Updated:
Jan 5,2017 5:50 PM
	    english.gov.cn












A five-year plan (2016-2020) to save energy and cut emissions was issued by the State Council on Jan 5, 2017, setting a goal to cut energy consumption by 15 percent in 2020 compared with 2015.
It vows to continue upgrading industry by cutting high-emission industries and promoting new industries, including cutting-edge information technology, new materials, new energy, biotechnology, energy-saving industry and digital creativity industry. It expects that the output value of low-carbon new industrials will surpass 10 trillion yuan in 2020.
Coal will be used more efficiently, and recyclable energy sources will be encouraged. The plan’s goal is that in 2020, the use of coal will account for less than 58 percent of total energy consumption.
Energy saving in key sectors will be promoted, including manufacturing, construction, transportation, trading, agriculture and public institutions.
The plan also urges cutting emissions of major pollutants from manufacturing industries, mobile sources, people’s daily life and agriculture.
Emission in key areas, especially those suffering from heavy air pollution, is underlined. Coal consumption will be controlled in those areas, and gas is encouraged as a replacement for coal. High emission industries in major rivers, including Yangtze River, Yellow River and Pearl River, are also urged to be controlled in order to deal with water pollution.
Authorities should take measures to urge industrial pollutant sources to reach emission standards, such as conducting environmental impact assessments and issuing pollutant emission licenses. As for mobile sources such as automobiles and ships, emission standards will be raised.
Circular economy will be promoted, with waste generated by industry, agriculture and urban residents being recycled. The government will support resource recycling companies and encourage them to use internet technologies. 
Supportive policies are also issued, including a pricing mechanism for resources, monetary and tax incentives and financing support. “Environmental protection tax will be levied,” the plan says.
Market mechanism will be used. For example, in 2017, a carbon emission trading market will be set up in China.
In addition, the plan also encourages everyone in China to join the effort by consuming in a low-carbon way, participating in public-interest activities, and bringing legal action against polluters. Media is also encouraged to cover contamination and violations against regulations.

Manufacturers’ environmental responsibility in China will be extended from production processes to the entire life cycle of products, including design, circulation, recycling and disposal, according to a State Council’s circular issued on Jan 3.
Taking the environmental impact of materials into consideration, manufacturers are required to design durable products with green packages, use renewable raw materials, and standardize recycling.
Manufacturers in four categories of products, including electrical appliances and electronic products, automobiles, lead-acid batteries and packing materials, are given priority to carry out extended producer responsibility, according to the circular.
They are encouraged to take the initiative to use renewable materials, and undertake recycling and processing of discarded products.
For electronics recycling, efforts should be made to build pilot recycling spots in commercial blocks and transportation hubs, and enhance electronic waste collection and sorting in communities and office buildings.
The circular encouraged automobile manufacturers to recycle scrapped cars and remanufacture products with the recycled auto parts. Also, it urged establishing a national management system for scrapped cars and recycling networks for power batteries from electric vehicles.
A national level goal should be set for recycling wasted lead-acid batteries and paper-based packaging products. Shanghai will be the first city to establish a recycling system for lead-acid batteries, according to the circular.
The circular also highlighted efforts to build a credit information collecting and sharing system for major manufacturers among the four categories, and improve related policies and regulations.
The document listed a total of 20 major tasks in promoting the moves, and departments and ministries, such as the National Development and Reform Commission and the ministries of environmental protection, finance, and commerce, will get involved in the efforts.

			State Council releases guidelines on establishing individual credit system






Updated:
Dec 30,2016 5:33 PM
	    english.gov.cn












To improve the credit level of the whole society, and create a better social credit environment, the State Council released guidelines on the construction of an individual credit system on Dec 30.
According to the guidelines, speeding up the individual credit system construction, and improving the security of individual information will help perfect the trust reward and punishment mechanism, and make trust a guiding principle for the whole society.
It said several measures will be taken to improve the registration work.
First is recording the individual credit records. The individual real-name registration system will be improved, and a unified social credit code system will be built based on the ID number of citizens. During the recording process, citizens’ registered information in internet, delivery, telecom and financial sectors will be helpful for improving the collection accuracy.
It also urged concentrating the registration efforts in key sectors such as food and drugs, work safety, environmental protection, work security and engineering construction. To help ensure that the information is accurate, the main subjects will be lawyers, teachers, civil servants and real estate brokers.
Second is improving individual information security, including strengthening piracy protection, and establishing a credit repair mechanism.
Third is promoting sharing of individual credit information. A national unified individual public credit information catalogue, classification standards and sharing exchange standards will be established. And governments at all levels should provide individual public information inquiry services to the public.
Fourth is perfecting the incentive and punishment mechanisms of individual credit. People who have good credit scores would be offered more social conveniences, especially more opportunities in education, employment, and entrepreneurship.
Citizens with bad credit scores may be punished according to related laws and regulations, said the guidelines.

Energy should be saved and the environment should be protected as the city develops, by cutting high-pollution industries, pollutant emissions, disposing sewage and waste as well as developing a greenbelt. Natural reserves, including Songhuahu lake, wetlands and water sources, were underlined.
As a historical city, Jilin is also urged to protect its cultural relics, such as the Jilin Confucius Temple and attractions along Songhua River.

			Govt releases plan to fight poverty in five years






Updated:
Dec 2,2016 9:54 PM
	    english.gov.cn












A plan to fight poverty in the next five years was released by the State Council on Dec 2, aimed at lifting all poor people who live in rural regions out of poverty in 2020.
By 2020, their income will be doubled and all of them will enjoy basic education, healthcare, safe place to live, enough food and clothes.
The current Chinese poverty line is 2,855 yuan ($414.5) per year, equal to $2.19 per day, which is higher than the international benchmark ($1.9). 
At the end of 2015, the number of rural residents under the poverty line was 560 million, according to data from the State Council. 
The following measures will tackle poverty from 11 aspects:
Economic development

The plan urges local authorities in poor regions to promote their competitive industries and products, especially labor-intensive ones, based on resource endowment. 
Key industries that will be promoted include agriculture, forestry, tourism, e-commerce and high-tech sector.
In addition, the State Council encourages poor families to pool their land in enterprises or other economic entities as shares, so that they can enjoy dividends. 
Job creation 

The government vows to create more jobs for poor people. Those enterprises who enjoy government subsidies should hire the poor first, the plan said.
For those who work in other places, local governments should provide them with basic public services, such as basic education for their children and public housing.
Local governments are also urged to provide more vocational training to the poor. In particular, free training will be provided to children of poor families, migrant workers, graduates of middle schools.
Relocation

As an important move in fighting poverty, 9.81 million people living in poor regions where the natural environment is uninhabitable and social economic conditions are underdeveloped will be moved to other places that are more favorable for living.
The government will invest 60 billion yuan to build apartments for those relocated. Supporting facilities, including water supply, electricity, and transportation, will also be constructed, as well as public services such as healthcare and education.
Education

Facilities of the schools and kindergartens in poor regions will be improved, according to the plan. 
The teachers in those schools will receive more training. And their salaries will be raised. 
For poor students, fees in higher middle school will be free. And more money will be provided to support their college education.
In addition, the government also plans to build more vocational schools for the poor students who cannot enter college.
Healthcare

The hospitals in poor regions will receive more support, including money, vocational training and technology.
Medical insurance for the poor will be enhanced. Those suffering major diseases will be provided with more reimbursement.
Ecological protection

The plan urges protection of the ecological environment in poor regions, especially in West China, so as to ensure sustainable development.
For those farmers who suffer financial loss in environmental protection — for example, due to ban on cutting trees or grazing — the government will provide them with compensation.
Social insurance system

The government will improve rural minimum living standard guarantee system and the pension system.
Children and disabled poor people will also receive more care from the government.
Apart from the above measures, the plan also urges enterprises, military and NGOs to join in the fight against poverty, and to improve the infrastructure and utilities in poor regions.

			State Council rolls out big plans to improve environment during 2016-2020






Updated:
Dec 5,2016 5:17 PM
	    english.gov.cn












China will strengthen efforts to improve environment quality and enhance environment governance during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), according to a plan issued by the State Council on Dec 5.
Improving the environment is one of the major issues for the world’s second-largest economy as the nation now focuses on the significance of both economic and environment improvement.
Industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization will expand further during the 13th Five-Year Plan period, which is also a crucial time to improve the environment.
The major target of the plan is to actualize an overall improvement of the country’s environment with green practices in production and daily life, less pollution, and stable biological diversity.
To enhance green development, efforts will be made to promote supply-side structural reform, reducing outdated overcapacity and improving energy efficiency.
Technology innovation will play a leading role in green development and environment protection.
Coordination of green development among different regions will be done across the nation, and international cooperation such as green construction of the Belt and Road initiative will also be carried out.
Action plans will be made to deal with air, water and soil pollution.
For example, air quality information from each province will be released regularly, and air pollution predictions will be shared across the country.
A unified plan, standards, regulation, and management regarding air pollution control will be set among the regions of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River, and Pearl River Delta.
A special campaign will be rolled out nationwide to monitor and curb emissions of industrial pollutants with technologies in place for enterprises to treat pollution, and failing to meet standards will result in fines and be made public. 
Meanwhile, efforts should be made to enhance infrastructure, with sewage treatment available in all counties and major towns by 2020. Goals for waste treatment are 95 percent for urban areas and 90 percent for rural areas. 
Clean energy projects will be made a priority, and the share of coal in total energy consumption will be reduced to 58 percent or lower by 2020, leading to a more clean approach.
Rural environment will continue to improve, as more efforts will be concentrated on waste treatment, contamination prevention in poultry farming, control of agricultural waste, and better utilization of straw. 
Environment risks will be under routine management, with strict controls on hazards from heavy metals, dangerous chemicals, nuclear materials and radiation, safeguarding the ecosystem and society.
During the 13th Five-Year Plan, more work will be done to protect ecological security. The nation will build several ecological shields to safeguard regional environment, including the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau ecological zone, the Loess Plateau-Sichuan-Yunnan ecological zone, and the northeast forest zone.
Major ecological areas will be under better protection and management, and new national parks will be built. At the same time, the nation will step up efforts to protect forests, grassland, and wetlands.
In the next five years, more grain plots and pastures will be returned to grassland, and 14 million hectares of forests will be planted, providing 95 million cubic meters of timber each year.
While limiting and controlling soil erosion and desertification, the nation will continue to promote the green industry, restore urban ecosystems, and protect natural landscapes and biodiversity.
Rule of law and the market will be improved and highlighted to fight illegal actions, and efficiency of environmental protection will be improved by leveraging all related parties.
Local governments, enterprises and the general public will be mobilized into the environmental protection effort through various system arrangements, including lifetime accountability, emission permits, and promotion of green consumption.

	    english.gov.cn












China is set to curb greenhouse gas emissions and promote green and low-carbon development during the 13th Five-Year Plan period, according to a plan recently issued by the State Council.
According to the plan, by 2020, the level of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be 18 percent lower than in 2015.
To do this, a low carbon energy revolution will be carried out across the nation.
By 2020, carbon emissions will be restrained as total energy consumption will be kept within five billion tons of standard coal and energy consumption per unit of GDP will be 15 percent lower than in 2015.
Another move is to promote energy conservation in industrial, construction, public transport sectors.
Non-fossil energy will also be developed, including nuclear power, wind power, solar power, geothermal power, and biomass power.
Traditional fossil energy consumption will be optimized as total coal consumption in 2020 will be kept at 4.2 billion tons.
Efforts will also be made to create low carbon industries, and by 2020 carbon dioxide emissions per industrial added value will be 22 percent lower than in 2015.
Initiatives such as zero use of chemical fertilizers will be carried out to promote low carbon agriculture. And to create more carbon sinks, efforts will be made in forestation so that the forest coverage rate across the nation will reach 23.04 percent by 2020.
Urbanization featuring intelligent, green and low carbon development will be underway while the nation promotes a low carbon modern transportation system.
Effective recycling and disposal of household wastes and the promotion of a low carbon lifestyle will also contribute to the nation’s growing efforts in promoting low carbon green development.
The nation will also witness the establishment of a carbon emission trading system which will cover eight industrial sectors such as petrochemical, steel, paper making, and aviation industries.
Efforts will also be made to encourage low carbon technology innovation, formulate related laws, regulations and standard systems, and carry out international cooperation.

			China’s plan to promote modern agriculture






Updated:
Oct 20,2016 7:48 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The Chinese government will take more measures to develop modern agriculture in the next five years, according to a plan released by the State Council on Oct 20.
The objective is to build an efficient, environment-friendly and resource-saving agriculture, improve farmers’ income and maintain the supply of agricultural products.
According to the plan, the national output of grain in 2020 is expected to reach 550 million tons, 50 million tons more than that in 2015. The personal productivity is expected to get to over 47,000 yuan, compared with just 30,000 yuan in 2015. 
In order to achieve the goals, the State Council has called for the promotion of the agriculture restructure by upgrading plantation structure, improving the quality of animal husbandry and upgrading fishery industry. 
It also plans to improve agricultural technology and the integration with information industry. 
The plan also wants to reform the agricultural management, to set up a joint-stock system of rural collective asset, offering shares and dividend to rural residents. 
The plan stressed balanced development of agriculture, with efforts to promote integrated development among primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, and to establish a productivity layout suitable for each region’s resources and environmental carrying capacity.
Cultivating professional farmers and new-type entities is another key task. It urged leading enterprises to lead rural residents develop moderate-scale management of farming.
It also highlighted green agriculture, calling for efforts to protect arable land, water resources, forests and wetlands, grasslands, fishery resources, and biodiversity.
To maintain agricultural environment, the plan urged to curb the use of fertilizer as well as pesticides, and to promote safe disposal of agricultural wastes.
It stressed the importance of ensuring agricultural product quality and safety, with efforts to establish a tracking system, improve the standardized production capacity and the leading role of high-quality agricultural product brands. 
The plan also called for the expansion of external cooperation of agriculture industry, with efforts to optimize cooperation layout and promote the healthy development of the trade of agricultural products. 
By relying on the country’s traditional edge in export trade sectors of fruits, vegetables, teas and aquatic products, China will establish a batch of demonstration bases for high-quality and safe agricultural products and cultivate a number of agricultural brands with international clout, said the plan. 
In addition, it urged the improvement of rural infrastructures, build beautiful villages suitable for living, and promote the urbanization of rural migrants by providing them with permanent residency and equal access to public services. 
Moreover, financial support will be reinforced for agricultural industry, including policies to optimize investment in agriculture and agricultural subsidies, said the plan

			China eyes life expectancy of 79 in 2030 health plan






Updated:
Oct 25,2016 8:34 PM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China wants to increase its citizens’ average life expectancy to 77.3 by 2020 and 79 by 2030, up from 76.34 in 2015, according to a plan on health development spanning the next 15 years.
The “Healthy China 2030” blueprint, released on Oct 25 by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council, includes 29 chapters that cover areas such as public health services, environment management, the medical industry, and food and drug safety.
While acknowledging the country’s health achievements so far, the blueprint noted that industrialization, urbanization, an aging population, as well as environmental and life style changes have created new challenges to the heath of the people, and state-level strategies are needed to solve “major and long-term health-related issues.” 

Health as habit
In order to reach the goal, the document said that health education will be incorporated into the entire education system, and a national nutrition plan should be established and implemented, with efforts to research food nutrition and monitor residents’ nutrition status.
According to the plan, the number of people “frequently participating in physical exercise” should increase to 530 million by 2030 from 360 million in 2014, and the smoking rate of those aged 15 or above should be lowered to 20 percent.
“Health is not just about curing illness. Prevention is the key,” said Liu Yuanli, head of the public health school under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
“With a focus on healthy life styles, the document places emphasis on health knowledge and skills, and encouraging good habits. This is the best approach,” Liu said.
The document suggested that to cut the number of smokers, measures such as higher taxes on cigarettes and stricter legislative should be rolled out. Moreover, it offered proposals for mental health intervention, safe sex and drug-addict rehabilitation.
In addition, the infant mortality rate should be lowered to five out of every 1,000 live births by 2030, down from the current eight. Mortality rates for children under the age of five and pregnant women should also decrease notably.
Health for all
China will also endeavor to ensure residents of rural and urban areas enjoy equal access to basic health services, the blueprint said.
To this end, according to the blueprint, China aims to have three certified or assistant doctors, and 4.7 registered nurses, for every 1,000 residents by 2030.
In recent years, the central government has invested heavily in improving medical services at the local level, it has financed the building of community health service centers, township health centers and village clinics, said Li Bin, head of the National Health and Family Planning Commission.
The greatest challenge lies in a shortage of health personnel at the local level, Li said, adding that every locality was different and should be treated as such when problems are addressed.
Better health environment
China also wants to continue to improve the environment, evident by increases in days of fine air quality and high-quality surface water.
In 2020, cities at the prefecture level and above will enjoy good air quality during more than 80 percent of the year, with further progress expected by 2030, the blueprint said.
In rural areas, in particular, greater efforts will be made to improve garbage disposal and treatment of sewage, as well as expanding the use of clean energy and access to safe drinking water.
By 2030, China will also have a nationwide network for monitoring food safety and recording food-borne diseases, according to the blueprint.
The blueprint suggests that more must be done to modernize techniques, equipment and products that are highly polluting or pose risks to the environment, and transforming industries like iron and steel, cement, petrochemicals so they work within emission standards.
It also called for more to be done to improve the handling of the standardization of agricultural production, evaluation of agro-products quality, proper handling of pesticides and veterinary drugs, as well as heavy metal pollution.

Some industrial parks, research centers and corporation headquarters will be constructed to optimize its industry layout and develop a rehabilitation and assistive products industry with high added value and low resource consumption. 
Meanwhile, smart manufacturing technologies — such as industrial internet, cloud computing and big data — are expected to be applied to product research and design, production, business management, and sales and service, to upgrade the rehabilitation and assistive products industry.
Productive services, including financing, e-commerce, outsourcing and branding, should be strengthened to optimize the industry chain and accelerate efficient flow of industry elements, said the document.
Corporations in the industry are also encouraged to carry out international cooperation in trade, technology, and investment and production capability.

Cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, VR and brain — computer interfaces, are encouraged to be used in the products. 
In addition, rehabilitation and assistive devices that are integrated with traditional Chinese medical care are also encouraged.
The plan also called for a sound market environment through establishing an internationally recognized certification system for rehabilitation and assistive products. Efforts should also be made to improve the standard for rehabilitation products and impose punishments on fake products with poor quality, said the document.
It also called for favorable financial policies set for related enterprises, including tax benefits. And the government should support the bonds and securities or other financial derivatives issued by any eligible rehabilitation product enterprises.

			China to use resource development for poverty relief






Updated:
Oct 18,2016 3:35 PM
	    english.gov.cn












China plans to better benefit the impoverished population by establishing a distribution system of profits earned through resource development in poor regions, according to a circular released on Oct 18.
The plan is aimed at encouraging economic organizations and individuals in poor regions to voluntarily participate in local resource development, including water, electricity and minerals, while seeking targeted poverty relief through distributing profits to registered low-income families.
The plan will be tested in a three-year trial period from 2016 to 2019. 
During the trial period, the plan will only target concentrated poverty-stricken areas and key projects under national anti-poverty and development. Priority will be given to poor counties located in old revolutionary bases and ethnic regions. 
The number of pilot projects across the nation will be under 20, which will include water, electricity or mining projects occupying rural collective land. These pilot projects should meet standards set by related planning, industrial policies and environmental protection laws and satisfy basic requirements in several aspects such as construction scale, requisition of land, construction period and profitability. And there are no specific requirement on the ownership of project undertakers. 
According to the circular, assets that can be invested in the resource development are limited to land compensation fees for non-construction land, which is entrusted to rural collective economic organizations. 
The plan also listed the entities that are qualified to be stakeholders and beneficiaries of development projects. The rural collective economic organizations will be stakeholders and registered low-income families the first beneficiaries.
Members of rural collective economic organizations, especially registered impoverished families, should be entitled to participate in the management and profit-sharing of the collective equity over development projects. And their rights and interests should be protected by law. 
In addition, the circular requires that policy measures, operation guidelines and actual implementation advice should be provided to further ensure the success of the pilot program.

The State Council issued a circular on Sept 20 on promoting the sustainable development of startup investment, as an effort to advance mass entrepreneurship and innovation in China. 
The circular decided to encourage multiple investors to set up venture capital enterprises or pour money into startups. The investors include investment agencies that have rich resources in entrepreneurship and innovation, such as leading enterprises, business incubators and insurance asset management institutions. 
Private investors with capital strength and management expertise are also welcomed to get involved in such investment. In addition, the circular encouraged efforts to set up market-based and specialized funds for startup investment. 
It also called for initiatives to expand the group of angel investors, with efforts to promote their information exchanges and cooperation with venture capital enterprises. It also vowed to regulate online equity financing platforms, providing information and technology services for private investors. 
The State Council also vowed to expand channels for investment capital, supporting investment agencies, including State-owned enterprises, insurance companies and university funds, to invest in venture capital enterprises or funds. 
A long-term and market-oriented cooperation mechanism between venture capital enterprises and varied financial institutions will be established, in a bid to further lower the threshold of startup investment for commercial insurance capital, according to the circular.
Financial institutions are also encouraged to conduct mergers and acquisitions loans for startups. 
The State Council aims to strengthen policy support for startup investment, such as conducting tax reduction for venture capital enterprises and mulling over pilot income tax policy for angel investors. 
The advantage of government projects will be fully taken in the country’s high-tech and innovation bases, so as to guide venture capital to national science and technology programs. 
Policy support, including the issuance of corporate bonds and market withdrawal, will be provided for venture capital enterprises undertaking long-term or value investment. 
Meanwhile, the government has decided to optimize the investment environment, with efforts to work out more favorable measures and deepen reforms by streamlining administration, delegating powers, improving regulation and providing better services. 
The government will also loosen market access and strengthen supervision over the venture capital industry, and improve information and risk disclosure, setting up an investment assessment mechanism to ensure real, valuable and long-term investment. 
No regions or departments are allowed to adopt policies or measures that hinder the market access and development of venture capital enterprises and venture capital management enterprises, according to the circular.

			State Council issues guideline on division of financial powers 






Updated:
Aug 24,2016 8:45 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council on Aug 24 released a guideline on promoting the reform of dividing financial powers and expenditure responsibilities between central and local governments to improve their efficiency in providing public services.
Financial power is the government’s responsibility to provide public services with funds. And a clear division of responsibilities between central and local governments ensures that they properly exercise their financial powers. 
Since the reform and opening-up, the fiscal relationship between central and local governments has changed a lot, from the earliest highly centralized fiscal management system to the reform of taxation system in 1994, forming a clear framework for power division, according to the guideline.
It said the general principle is that financial powers should be decided by the central government.
The reform is aimed at promoting and improving the division of powers between central and local governments, and speeding up the responsibility division of governments below provincial levels.
The reform will reinforce the central government’s fiscal powers in guaranteeing national security, safeguarding a nationwide unified market, expressing social justice and promoting coordinated regional development.
Funding for basic public services closely related to local residents’ standard of living should be allocated by local governments, the guideline said.
It also urged reducing any overlapping administrative powers held by local and central governments to clarify responsibilities undertaken by governments at different levels.
Meanwhile, basic public services with clear strategic intention and cross-regional administration advantages will be designated a shared financial responsibility of both central and local governments.
The funds for financial powers that belong to the central government should be allocated by central finance. And in principle, local governments should use their own resources to exercise their financial powers.
Expenditures for basic public services involving nationality, citizens’ rights, national unified market and free flow of elements will be undertaken by the central and local governments according to a formula. 
Provincial level governments should take the central government’s practices as reference, and determine the expenditure responsibilities of governments below the provincial level according to their financial systems and local financial situations, the guideline said.
The responsibility division reform will be carried out in public services related to national defense and safety, foreign affairs and public security in 2016. And in 2017-18, the reform is expected to make big breakthroughs in public service sectors, including education, medical health, environmental protection and transportation.
In 2019 to 2020, reform in major areas will be basically completed, and a clear financial responsibility division between central and local governments will be formed.

The State Council on Sept 18 released a plan to push ahead building a national sci-tech innovation hub in the capital Beijing, growing it into a leading role in the country’s innovation drive and in the coordinated development with its neighboring regions. 
Mainly based at Zhongguancun’s innovation demonstration zone, Beijing will build an overall innovation system with science and technology at the core, according to the circular. It will also expand reform to remove institutional obstacles.
The plan puts forward three goals that will be phased in. By 2017, a primary innovation hub will be set up. By 2020, Beijing will see a complete sci-tech innovation system, leading the country’s R&D and being the booster for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area’s innovation drive. By 2030, it will be an important force of global innovation network.
To achieve these goals, the city will intensify efforts in the following aspects.
Construction of scientific research infrastructure will be strengthened, as three science and technology cities, including Zhongguancun Science City, Huairou Science Park, and Future Science and Technology City, will be built to gather science and technology institutions, universities, and enterprises and develop high-end science and technologies.
Based on its advantages in science and education, Beijing will focus innovation in sectors such as brain science, quantum computing and communications, and nano-science.
Talent, education and scientific research are also important to build a science and technology center, as Beijing will try to attract top scientists and build world-class universities and scientific research institutions.
Industrial technology innovation will be focused on intelligent manufacturing, biological medicine, integrated circuit, mobile technology, aviation and aerospace, and green manufacturing, and a group of international competitive leading companies will be cultivated in Beijing.
Modern service industry featuring information technology will be advanced. Science and technology innovation achievements will be enjoyed by all, as technological innovation will be applied to improve ecological environment, food security, medical treatment, and public security.
Efforts will also be made to promote the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated innovation and cultivate world-class innovative city clusters.
International high-end innovation institutions, research and development centers for transnational companies, and international science and technology organizations are encouraged to establish international science and technology centers in Beijing as an effort to bring together international innovation resources.
Enterprises are encouraged to set up international innovation networks, and service platforms will be set up in research and development cooperation, technology standards, intellectual property, and cross-border acquisition.
To promote innovation reform, efforts will also be made to reform talent development mechanism, improve the service system for innovation and entrepreneurship, boost the construction of national science and finance innovation centers, create a fair market environment, and promote modern government management on innovation.

			State Council approves Yinchuan’s city plan in NW China






Updated:
Sep 12,2016 3:24 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The overall development plan for Yinchuan was approved by the State Council on Sept 12. It is a road map for the capital city of Northwest China’s Ningxia autonomous region from 2011 to 2020.
Urban and rural development should be integrated, said the plan, and the construction of infrastructure and public services in urban areas should take into account the surrounding rural areas to help boost agricultural industrialization and economic modernization.
The scale of Yinchuan city’s growth will be controlled, so that by 2020, the population of its central area will be capped at 1.3 million, and the area for urban construction will be set within 152.8 square kilometers. No extra development zones and new areas beyond the plan will be allowed.
The plan also urges utilizing the city’s underground space, improving the efficiency of land use and protecting arable land, especially primary farmlands.
Yinchuan will continue to improve its transportation infrastructure, including highways, railways and airports, to connect inbound and outbound traffic. For urban transport, the city will step up building a comprehensive network that centers on public transport tools, combining various other means, such as walking and bicycles.
Urban infrastructure construction also includes improving the city’s water supply and drainage systems and garbage disposal facilities.
A comprehensive disaster prevention and public security system covering firefighting, civil air defense, flood, earthquake and geological disasters prevention should also be set up, according to the document.
The plan also pledges to construct a resource-conserving and environment-friendly city, cutting energy emissions, eliminating backward industrial capacity, controlling contamination and promoting the construction of a sponge city.
More public services, including education and medical care, will be enhanced. Meanwhile, affordable housing will be part of the city’s construction plan, and renovation of shantytowns and dilapidated buildings will be accelerated in both urban and rural areas.
As a national historical and cultural city, Yinchuan is also asked to pay more attention to the protection of environment and historic sites, including ancient city pattern of the capital city and king’s tombs from the Kingdom of Western Xia (1038 — 1227).

The State Council on Aug 30 released a circular concerning the third comprehensive inspection of its departments and local governments in detail.
The inspection is aimed at urging authorities to implement major policies and projects, maintaining economic growth and achieving the goal of social-economic development this year.
It contains four aspects — maintaining steady economic development, promoting supply-side reform, enhancing innovation-driven development and protecting and improving people’s livelihood.
According to the circular, departments of the State Council and local governments should speed up the construction of large investment projects, including the railway investment of more than 800 billion yuan ($119.8 billion), highway investment of 1.65 trillion yuan, more than 20 big water conservancy projects, underground city tunnels of more than 2,000 kilometers, more than 6 million units in shantytown renovation projects and newly-built and renovated rural highways of 200,000 kilometers.
To maintain economic growth, local governments should also make efforts in boosting social investment, especially private investment; making good use of their idle funds allocated by the central finance; expanding consumption demand; promoting the development of foreign trade; and accelerating urbanization.
Seven items were laid out to promote supply-side reform. They include further deepening administrative reform and enhancing government services; eliminating the overcapacity in iron and steel industries, with this year’s goals of 45 million tons of crude steel and 250 million tons of coals to be cut; reducing inventory in the property sector; lowering corporate leverage ratio while increasing direct financing; cutting costs for enterprises through several measures such as replacing business taxes with value-added tax; improving weak links in infrastructure construction; and promoting reforms of State-owned enterprises.
To stimulate innovation-driven development, inspections will be carried out to promote building the first batch of the 28 entrepreneurship and innovation demonstration bases, implementation of “Made in China 2025” initiative and “Made in China Plus internet” strategy, and construction of coordinated innovation mechanism with an effort to promote applicable technology.
Inspections with regard to people’s livelihood involve government efforts in expanding employment and encouraging entrepreneurship mainly for college graduates, migrant workers, and the laid-off, aiming to meet the target of creating at least 1,000 jobs this year. Meanwhile, policy practices in improving indemnificatory housing management, farmers’ income, education, healthcare, social security system, and environment protection will be under inspection.
Thirty-one provincial regions will receive the inspection. Departments and provincial-level governments should send self-evaluation reports to the State Council by Sept 15. Inspection group will conduct on-site inspections from Sept 18 to Sept 30, and report to the State Council before Oct 10.

			Key border development area approved in Guangxi






Updated:
Aug 12,2016 2:21 PM
	    english.gov.cn












A new experimental area for development and opening up in the city of Pingxiang, southwest China’s Guangxi province, was approved by the State Council on Aug 12.
Sitting on the border with Vietnam, Pingxiang city has served as a bridgehead for China’s opening-up and cooperation with Vietnam and other ASEAN countries. Construction of the experimental area in the city is thus seen as an important move to promote the Belt and Road initiative, accelerate the development of border areas, and improve the new pattern of China’s all-around opening-up. 
The experimental area is urged to boost connectivity in infrastructure, promote the transformation and upgrading of trade and investment, develop advantageous industries, and accelerate the construction of new-type urbanization. 
These efforts are called for in constructing the area into an essential platform for developing a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Vietnam, a frontier zone for upgrading the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (CAFTA), and a growth point for economic development of the border area in the southwest regions, propelling Guangxi province into a corridor to effectively connect with ASEAN countries and countries along the Belt and Road. 
The government of Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region should effectively promote the construction and development of the experimental area, with planning and construction in accordance with the overall planning concerning land use, urban layout, environmental protection and water resources. 
Related departments of the State Council are asked to perform their functions in reinforcing support for the construction of the area, as well as provide positive support in terms of policy-making, capital investment and project arrangement.

			Building a well-off society for the disabled






Updated:
Aug 17,2016 9:01 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has released an outline on improving the lives of the disabled and building a society suitable for the group, in the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020).
According to the plan, the country is aimed at perfecting the system to protect the rights of the disabled, increase product supply, increase their incomes, and help them live a better life.
To achieve these goals, the government intends to make sure the disabled enjoy the same livelihood guarantees and public services as ordinary people. The plan also urges authorities to utilize the functions of social forces, organizations for the disabled and market mechanisms to meet the multi-layer and various needs of the disabled, while also creating a convenient and friendly living environment for them.
Qualified families of the disabled should enjoy minimum living allowances, preferential policies and subsidies for their use of water, electricity, gas and heat power, and measures should also be taken to support blind and deaf people consume information.
All regions should give convenience and privileges to the disabled when they use public transport or visit parks and scenic spots, while public cultural and sports utilities must be open to the disabled for free or with preferential prices, according to the plan.
Disabled persons in urban and rural areas should enjoy basic pension and medical insurance, as their participation rate in pension is expected to reach around 90 percent by 2020, and in medical insurance the rate will be about 95 percent.
Building a caring service system for the disabled should be based on family nursing, rely on the community and utilize support from foster institutions, which the plan says should also improve their service levels for the disabled.
The plan urges authorities to provide caring services for disabled seniors and provide more policy support for the families adopting disabled children.
To create a better life for the disabled, the plan calls for more disabled people to be employed and an increase in their families’ income.
Government institutions, organs, corporate units and State-owned enterprises will play a leading role in recruiting disabled people, according to the plan. Individual businesses should be encouraged to provide jobs for the disabled through policy support. Authorities should also help arrange business places and provide startup funds for disabled entrepreneurs.
By 2020, all registered disabled people from poor families in rural areas must be out of poverty, the plan says.
To improve their education, the plan calls for disabled students and teenagers from poor families to be exempt from compulsory and high school tuition fees. It also wants recovery institutions to apply for kindergarten permissions and common kindergartens to enroll disabled children.
The plan has regulated that the proportion of disabled children receiving compulsory education must reach 95 percent by 2020.
To provide disabled people with access to the internet, the plan calls for building a website to service the disabled, while also exploring a new model to provide assistance for the disabled in using the internet.
The plan also urges authorities to build a basic public service network for the disabled to connect counties, townships and villages, set up public service platforms such as recovery equipment, foster services, vocational training, suited assistive devices at county level, and regulates that the coverage rate of basic recovery services must reach 80 percent by 2020.

			China to improve petrochemical industry






Updated:
Aug 3,2016 2:28 PM
	    english.gov.cn












China will optimize the structure of its petrochemical industry and boost green development, according to a guideline issued by the State Council on Aug 3, 2016.
Since the reform and opening-up, China’s petrochemical industry has witnessed major development as petrochemical product output ranks globally among those at the top.
But at the same time, problems such as overcapacity, inadequate innovation, unimproved industrial structure, and increasing environmental protection pressure hinder the industry’s further development.
To solve such problems, the State Council set targets to reduce outdated technology and production facilities and close down hazardous chemical production enterprises in populated regions and environmentally sensitive areas.
To advance green development, energy consumption, dioxide emission and water usage per 10,000 yuan industrial added value will be lowered 8 percent, 10 percent, and 14 percent, respectively, compared with the indicators in the 12th Five-Year Plan period (2011-2015).
The State Council also plans to increase the industry’s innovation capabilities as investment in scientific research will account for more than 1.2 percent of the industry’s revenue.
To transform traditional industry, advanced technologies for clean production and intelligent control will be applied to improve current manufacturing facilities and production quality and lower energy consumption.
Efforts also will be made to promote corporation merger and reorganization, strengthen international production capacity cooperation, improve industrial policies, increase financial support and strengthen industry regulation.

			China to lower costs for real economy enterprises






Updated:
Aug 22,2016 5:38 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has issued a circular to urge reducing costs for enterprises to ensure the stable growth of the real economy. 
According to the circular, initial cost reduction should be made in the first one to two years, and enterprises should see rising profits in three years, after a reasonable cut in costs. 
In order to cut taxes, the pilot program to replace the business tax with a value-added tax should be expanded to construction, real estate, finance, and services to ensure an actual reduction in the tax burden. 
In addition, more work should be done to implement preferential tax policies on research and energy-saving and environmental protection equipment, streamline administrative charges concerning enterprises, and cancel some governmental funds, with exemption of contribution extended to more SMEs. 
The circular said an appropriate monetary and financial environment is needed to keep reasonable liquidity. 
Meanwhile, efforts should be made to reduce intermediate fees, strengthen financing guarantees, optimize evaluation and supervision on commercial banks, encourage establishment of private banks and equity financing, and guide enterprises to use low-cost overseas capital.
The document called for reduction of institutional transaction costs with efforts to break regional isolation and industry monopoly, deepen reform in streamlining administration, improving regulation and optimizing services, cut service fees, and solve any lingering problems at State-owned enterprises.
At the same time, the social credit system should be put in place to protect intellectual property rights to help enterprises safeguard their interests. 
The circular urged cutting labor costs, including measures to reduce contributions to the social security and housing fund, and optimize the mechanism on minimum wages. Meanwhile, reform should be carried out to reduce enterprises’ costs in energy consumption and land use.
As another area to cut costs, logistics should be improved to encourage resource sharing, with measures to standardize transportation fees for roads, flights, and railways, and eliminate any improper charges. 
In order to improve capital turnover, asset security and financial leasing are encouraged to liquidate stock assets, and more support should be in place to ensure constant capital support to enterprises. Local governments should take measures to pay off project arrears and regulate earnest payments in the construction sector to reduce the burden on enterprises. 
The circular also called for establishing supporting mechanisms, pushing forward institutional reforms, encouraging innovation and improving public services to support efforts in cost reduction.

	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued a guideline on July 28 to actively and steadily promote the reform of the taxi industry.
Structural reform of the taxi industry should adhere to the development concepts of innovation, coordination, low-carbon, openness and sharing, give full play to the roles of market mechanisms and government guidance, and prioritize the development of public transportation, in a bid to promote the healthy and sustainable development of the industry, according to the guideline. 
Local governments are urged to seize the favorable opportunity brought by the implementation of “Internet Plus” initiative to regulate the operation of online taxi booking services, and explore management models in line with the actual development of local taxi industries. 
The guideline also calls for the coordinated development of regular taxis and online taxi booking services to provide high-quality and diversified transport services. And new energy vehicles should be given priority when adding or replacing taxi cars. 
To expand the reform of regular taxis, the guideline puts forward the following requirements: Franchises for newly-added taxi cars should be free, and should not be sold or transferred without authorization within their valid periods. Taxi operators should sign labor or operating contracts with the taxi drivers. Local governments should determine and adjust the price level and structure of local taxi services by taking into account the operating costs of taxis, income level of residents and drivers, and traffic conditions. They should also encourage the enterprises operating taxis to provide online taxi booking services and promote non-cash payment methods.
For online taxi booking services, drivers and their vehicles should meet the basic requirements of passenger transport services. And online taxi booking platforms should strengthen management over their vehicles and drivers, and determine the methods for calculating mileages and fares, according to the guideline.
The guideline also urges local governments to improve service facilities, strengthen the construction of a credit system and enhance market supervision to build a favorable market environment.

			State Council to implement compulsory education reform in urban and rural areas






Updated:
Jul 11,2016 7:18 PM
	    english.gov.cn












Reform to integrate compulsory education in urban and rural areas and improve education in rural areas will be implemented, according to a circular issued by the State Council on July 11.
The reform is set to break down educational gaps between urban and rural areas and coordinate compulsory education with urbanization at the county level by 2020, further improving the quality and equality of compulsory education.
To make sure students can go to school in nearby neighborhoods, local governments should build schools while carrying out residential construction projects, the State Council said.
In addition, schools will be placed in rural areas where transportation is convenient and public services have already been established.
Training will be provided to principals and teachers in rural schools and teachers in urban schools will be selected on job rotations in rural schools.
The education standards of boarding schools and small rural schools will be improved and subsidies on them will be increased accordingly.
In some rural schools, a class used to have more than 60 students. To solve that problem, the reform is set to cancel big classes that are crowded with more than 56 students by 2020, providing students with a better education environment.
Local governments should also carry out preferential income policies for rural teachers and improve living subsidies for teachers working in impoverished rural areas, making sure the income level of rural teachers is not lower than their counterparts who teach in counties and towns, according to the State Council.
School admission policies will be further reformed to enable children to enjoy education at cities where their parents obtained residential permits.
More care and protection will be devoted to left-behind children in rural areas. Parents are encouraged to send their children to cities where they work, as long as they are granted local residential permits.

			State Council urges effective implementation of private investment policies






Updated:
Jul 4,2016 9:02 AM
	    english.gov.cn












The General Office of the State Council on July 4 issued a circular, urging governments at all levels and related departments to promote the healthy development of private investment and ensure the effective implementation of relevant policies.
The document stressed the importance of sound development of private investment, saying that private economy created about 60 percent of China’s GDP and 80 percent of social employment opportunities. It has accounted for over 60 percent of China’s total fixed asset investment and become a crucial basis for stabilizing the country’s economy.
However, reports from an extensive inquiry on private investment across the country revealed problems in some regions and sectors, such as private enterprises’ difficulties in enjoying the same benefits as State-owned enterprises and obtaining financing. Provincial, regional and municipal governments and related departments are urged to make timely corrections and improvements to strengthen and improve work concerning private investment promotion.
Their correction reports and work plans in the next stage should be submitted to the General Office of the State Council before Aug 15 and copied to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) at the same time. The NDRC will start a special inspection to the provinces and regions with falling growth of private investment beginning in mid-July.
The documents also required local governments to further carry out reforms on administrative streamlining, delegating power and optimizing services, removing more administrative approvals for private firms and improving service capability. In the second half of this year, the Reform Office of the State Council will jointly work with relevant departments to carry out an inspection concerning those reforms.
Regarding creating a fair competitive market environment, the document urged a quick introduction of the negative list on market access and opening more sectors, such as civil airports and oil and gas exploration and development. It also called local governments to cancel additional conditions and discriminatory provisions aimed at private enterprises on market access, resource location and government services. The self-check results by local governments on this aspect should also report to the General Office of the State Council and the NDRC before Aug 15.
In addition, the document also demanded efforts be made to mitigate difficulties faced by private enterprises when applying for loans, such as high charges. The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) should promptly conduct special inspections in conjunction with related departments, and urge the banking industry and financial institutions to strictly implement various policies and measures to support the development of the real economy, especially ensuring the growth rate of loans for small- and micro-sized enterprises, the document said.
Meanwhile, local governments should proactively promote the improvement of financial services, expand financing channels for private enterprises and lower financing costs. And the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and Xinhua News Agency should strengthen investigation and appraisal of the financing conditions of private enterprises, and in a timely manner, make their appeals heard.
The Ministry of Finance is urged to expedite special inspections on streamlining enterprise charges in conjunction with related departments, including the NDRC to further reduce enterprises’ costs and burden. And the National Audit Office should prioritize the audit of enterprise charges in tracking the progress of implementing related policies, according to the document.
The State Council also stressed the responsibilities of local governments and departments. They should pay close attention to stimulating the enthusiasm of private investment and promoting its healthy development. An accountability system is also required to enhance the credibility of local governments.
Furthermore, governments at provincial and municipal levels and all related departments are also urged to improve their mechanisms of releasing policy and interpenetration, and promptly respond to social concerns to boost confidence in private investment.

			State Council calls for speeding up business registration reform






Updated:
Jul 5,2016 4:36 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued a circular on July 5 to further speed up business registration reform in China.
The State Council decided to officially implement the “five-in-one business license” starting on Oct 1 to reduce administrative approvals for start-ups and improve the overall business environment, according to the circular.
“Five-in-one business license” features a standardized national credit number, which covers business license, tax registration, organization code, public security and social security. And it also contains a two-digit that any official or individual can scan using a smart phone and immediately see all the relevant information about the company. The registration system reform requires each applicant to offer only one essential business certificate to one business administration office, largely improving efficiency and cutting red tape.
In the circular, the State Council decided to promote an online management system for business registration and establish an information sharing platform between all the related departments. 
In addition, the circular urged properly handling the transition work. Companies registered under the “three-in-one business license” do not need to submit new five-in-one applications. Their information will be submitted to related departments by their original registration organs. 
The State Council also mandated supporting the extensive use of the new business license. Business licenses should be used in all registration affairs and not any other kind of licenses or cards. And it should be recognized and accepted at all government departments, enterprises and institutions, and intermediary agencies.
The circular also urged enhancing the team building of those who handle the registration process and improving their service quality and work efficiency.

	    english.gov.cn












The State Council on June 20 decided to upgrade the domestic supply and demand structures by improving the quality of product brands in China.
To achieve that goal, the document mandates speeding up the transfer of government functions, innovating government management and services, improving legal support for brand development, perfecting support policies, expanding the publicity of brands with independent intellectual property rights, and encouraging the consumption of these brands.
Enterprises should invest more in brand establishment, increase independent innovation, enrich product categories, increase the quality of products, set up a brand management system and increase brand cultivation, said the document, adding that enterprises should train skilled staff, and cultivate more talent.
It asked intermediary agencies to increase their own functions to provide better services for brand establishment and industry upgrades, and industry associations should play their role as a communication bridge.
To better complete the task, the document highlighted several major projects in basic brand construction, supply and demand structural upgrades.
For brand construction, four tasks need to be covered. 
First, revise and improve product standards, and encourage enterprises to set standards that are higher than national and industrial levels to increase their market competitiveness;
Second, strengthen national test abilities, improve inspection levels for technology and equipment tests, encourage private enterprises and other private funds to invest in test services. It also supported qualified manufacturers to apply for related test qualifications and provide test services for the public, and urged establishing third-party test institutions with authority and credibility;
Third, set up research and development institutions, and encourage qualified enterprises to establish product innovation centers to improve their design of products;
Fourth, build up several brand evaluation research institutions to help release objective brand evaluation results and brand development index to increase their credibility.
For upgrades in supply structural reform, it required focusing on the primary, secondary and tertiary industries.
It supported leading food companies to increase their research and deep processing, and encourage enterprises to take advantage of modern technology to satisfy customers’ different demands to improve people’s quality of life.
In the agricultural sector, it asked to speed up setting up a supervision system for agricultural products, make food safety issues traceable and develop green and organic foods to increase food quality. 
In the industrial sector, it encouraged companies to conduct the research, production and application of strategic new materials, providing materials for the production of good products.
To upgrade the demand structures, the document asks for building up credible product quality platforms to publish comprehensive, timely and actual product information for consumers, and improving the quality awareness of people in rural areas and regulating the rural market by clearing out products without production dates, quality certificates and names of manufacturers.
It also encouraged residents in rural areas to change their durable consumer products, such as household appliances, furniture, cars and electronics, environmentally friendly.
To better achieve results and implement these measures, it required the government to actively use fiscal funds, bring in more private capital, and support the development of brands with independent intellectual property rights.
Financial institutions are encouraged to lend money to companies with their own trademarks and patents on mortgage, and the government should take incentive measures to encourage product innovation and promote the craftsman’s spirit.

			SOEs to cut irrelevant public service functions






Updated:
Jun 22,2016 11:16 AM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council issued a plan on June 22 to reduce the burden on State-owned enterprises by cutting “public service functions” that are not in line with their development direction.
According to the plan, SOEs will transfer water, electricity and heat supplies and property management services for their workers’ family communities to professional companies or organizations.
The move will help the State-owned enterprises to “concentrate on their major businesses, improve basic infrastructures, and further improve the living environment of SOE workers”, according to the State Council.
Submitted by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council and the Ministry of Finance and then approved by the State Council, the plan is set to finish the transfer before the end of 2018, which means that beginning in 2019, SOEs will not have to pay the “community services” for their workers.
The State-owned capital management budget will offer central government-controlled SOEs subsidies that account for 50 percent of the costs generated by the transfer.
Central government-controlled group companies and companies that supervise the SOEs that undertake the transfer will pay no less than 30 percent of such costs. The rest of the costs will be paid by SOEs themselves.
In the past, SOES usually built living communities for their workers and paid the cost of water, electricity, and heat supplies and property management services of the communities.

			China to push integrated development of transportation and logistics






Updated:
Jun 21,2016 6:46 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council approved an action plan, formulated by the National Development and Reform Commission, on June 21, to promote the integrated development of transportation and logistics industries and reduce the costs of social logistics.
The plan sets as targets building an open and sharing transportation system of logistics by 2018, with a “one waybill” transportation system and a railway system covering over 80 percent of China’s large ports and logistics parks.
And by 2020, China will see a batch of competitive transportation and logistics enterprises and a new system with standardized facilities, networked information, fair and orderly market, and safe and effective operations. By then, the coverage rate of urban and rural logistics distribution network will be raised by 10 percentage points.
It is crucial to turn railways into logistics hubs, such as ports, highway freight terminals, and logistic parks, said the circular, which also stressed the construction of urban beltways, and the effective connection of urban roads and highways in megacities to reduce cargo transport’s effect on urban transportation.
The plan urged the government to optimize the space for transportation hubs and logistics links, make efforts to build major roads for container transport by 2020, and drive the construction of railways and highways for passengers and freight, respectively, in the Yangtze River and Pearl River Delta regions. 
The government should enhance the services of multi-purpose and international transportation and support industry associations to launch plans to promote the one waybill system, with one-stop transfer and delivery, and charges.
The plan also highlighted establishing well-supervised platforms of transportation and logistics, including management platforms and information sharing platforms. 
The government should encourage social capital to participate in building a professional management platform for transportation information, logistics resources transactions, and bulk commodity transaction services. The management platform is expected to provide services such as information publishing, data analysis, and customer advisory.
An interactive online and offline highway port network and a standardized transportation model and intelligent distribution system should also be encouraged and promoted, said the circular.
In addition, related supervision should be strengthened for all platforms in order to create a good market environment for the integrated development of the transportation and logistics industry, the circular added.

			Guideline to optimize industrial structure of building materials 






Updated:
May 18,2016 5:21 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council on May 18 issued a guideline to optimize the industrial structure of China’s building materials sector. 
With the goal of returning the utilization rate of the sector’s industrial capacity to a reasonable range, the guideline mandated further cutting the industrial capacity of one batch of cement residue and sheet glass enterprises by 2020. Meanwhile, the top 10 cement and glass manufacturing enterprises will have 60 percent of market share. 
In addition, the proportion of green building materials products will be steadily increased, and the supply for higher quality products will be reinforced. Also, profits for the building materials sector are expected to be increased, with the rate of profits for cement residue and sheet glass industry reaching industrial average. 
To reach these goals, construction projects to expand cement residue and sheet glass will be prohibited until 2020; replacing industrial capacity between different enterprises will also be suspended until 2017. 
Meanwhile, enterprises that fail to meet pollutant emission standards will be sanctioned, and serious violators could be suspended or shut down; enterprises whose energy consumption exceed the required limit or whose product quality fail to meet the national standards will be suspended for six months while the violations are rectified. If the standards still cannot be met after that, the enterprises will be ordered to shut down for good. 
Moreover, major enterprises will get support to establish platforms for the integration of industrial capacity, promote a united reshuffle as well as integrate property and management rights. 
In addition, the guideline encouraged promoting green building materials products that lead to energy conservation and environmental protection. It also supported developing clean and renewable energy, intelligent manufacturing and more processing of products. 
At the same time, it urged implementing action plans on the manufacturing and application of green building materials. It also called for strengthening financial support to promising and profitable building materials enterprises, such as providing loans for their mergers and acquisitions.

			State Council highlights key tasks in streamlining administration 






Updated:
May 24,2016 7:08 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council on May 24 released a document highlighting the key tasks in reforms concerning streamlining administration, combining power delegation with enhanced supervision and optimizing public services in 2016.
The reforms should be promoted in a wider range, a deeper level and more powerful measures to make the market play a decisive role in resource allocation and create a better business environment, said the document.
The first major task highlighted in the document is to continue administrative approval reform. This year, the government will further reduce more than 50 approval items at the State Council and local government levels, the document said, adding that more intermediary services approved by the State Council will be eliminated, and that approval items that must be kept should be standardized and further simplified.
The investment approval list will be revised again to cut more than 90 percent of projects that need to be approved by the central government, and the remaining investment projects will be registered and approved through a national online platform, according to the document.
In efforts to promote commercial business reform, the document said that one-third of pre-approval items for commercial registration will be cut this year, reducing more than 90 percent of the original items, and over 50 post-approval items at the same time will be canceled to lower the threshold for market access. In addition to the consolidation of three types of business licenses, social insurance and statistic code registration licenses will also be integrated into the “three-in-one business certificate”, bringing five licenses into one and reducing the operating costs for entrepreneurship.
In the reform relating to streamlining administration, the document also outlined enhancing vocational qualifications reform, expanding the autonomy rights of universities and scientific research institutions and further opening government affairs.
Meanwhile, the document also stressed strengthening innovative supervision work, through implementing a fair and comprehensive supervision and exploring supervision that uses new and innovative ways for the development of new technology, new industries, new businesses and new models. Besides the strong support for new economies, the government must be cautious and prevent possible risks, the document said. 
In addition, government services should be optimized and improved, including the services for mass entrepreneurship and innovation, to create a business environment that is international, law-based and convenient, said the document.

On May 31, the State Council issued a plan regarding prevention and remediation of soil pollution in a bid to comprehensively improve the nation’s soil quality by the mid-21st century. 
Currently, oil quality across the country is seeing many problems and soil pollution in some regions is serious.
To get a clear understanding of the national condition of soil quality, a further survey will be carried out and a nationwide monitoring network will be set up, according to the State Council.
Led by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the once-in-a-decade survey, which involves other ministries and local governments, will monitor overall soil quality.
A nationwide soil quality monitoring network will be established to monitor all regions across the country by 2020.
In addition, data from the ministries of environmental protection, land and resources, and agriculture will be used to establish a database. Mobile internet and the Internet of Things will be utilized to realize real-time data upgrades.
To prevent soil pollution, legislative efforts also will be taken, as laws and regulation systems concerning soil pollution prevention and remediation will be established by 2020.
Soil for agricultural purposes is categorized into three types to preserve the safety of agricultural products.
According to the plan, non-and-slightly-polluted soil will receive priority of protection; mildly-and-moderately polluted soil will be ranked as safely usable and seriously-polluted soil will be under strict management.
Efforts will also be made to prevent overuse of agricultural fertilizers and pesticides that could endanger soil quality and soil contamination by industrial and mining sectors.

			China to boost general aviation industry






Updated:
May 17,2016 5:15 PM
	    english.gov.cn












On May 17, the State Council issued a guideline on the development of the general aviation industry, in an effort to boost the strategic new industry that saw rapid growth in recent years.
Data shows that as of the end of 2015, China’s general aviation industry had more than 300 airports, 281enterprises, and 1,874 aircrafts.
As part of efforts to promote industry transformation and upgrades, and to further tap consumption potential, an initiative is set to build a general aviation industry that has more than 500 general aviation airports, 5,000 aircraft, and a group of competitive enterprises by the end of 2020, according to the guideline.
To strengthen transportation services, efforts will be made to provide diversified services. For example, people in rural areas will be offered small aircraft and short-haul aviation services.
The developing general aviation industry will also benefit public services and production as it will be combined with rescue and relief work, medical aid, territorial resource exploration, environment monitoring and communication relay.
To encourage aviation consumption, general aviation is encouraged to integrate with the Internet, creative economy, and tourism, the guideline said.
According to the guideline, regional coordination should be strengthened to promote construction of all-purpose airports in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and other major city clusters.
Efforts will be made to boost aviation innovation and improve manufacturing capabilities in key aviation technologies.
Industry cluster is another target to promote industry transformation and upgrades, as 50 demonstration zones will be set up to promote aviation clusters, and international-advanced general aviation manufacturing enterprises will be forged.
International cooperation will be strengthened in aviation manufacturing, operations management and pilot training.
To ensure aviation safety, an integrated and traceable monitoring system that involves different departments and sectors will be established. The civil aviation administration will be responsible for the construction of a general aviation safety monitoring platform that has real-time monitoring capability thanks to information technologies such as mobile Internet and big data.

			Ecological protection compensation to be further improved






Updated:
May 13,2016 5:11 PM
	    english.gov.cn












To speed up the building of an ecological civilization and better protect the ecological environment, the State Council decided to improve the compensation mechanism for ecological protection in China.
The new mechanism would charge those who benefit from ecological environment protection and give compensation to people who protect the environment, according to the document released on May 13.
The government will play a leading role in protecting the ecological environment, perfect related laws, innovate the systems and mechanisms, expand the compensation channels and increase the purchase of services through economic and legal means, said the document. 
By 2020, key ecological areas such as forestry, grasslands, wetlands, deserts, oceans, water flows, arable lands and forbidden development zones should be covered by the compensation mechanism. And the compensation should consider local social and economic development conditions. 
The document also said that for different kinds of key ecological areas, the compensation should be different.
The document called for multiple channels to raise the compensation funds. It also urged the central budget to increase the transfer payment for key ecological areas and raise investment in the infrastructure and public facilities in those areas. 
It asked governments at provincial levels to perfect the transfer payment system and set up province-based compensation funds and increase support for provincial ecological areas. 
The document called for improving related regulations on the non-gratuitous use of ecological resources such as forestry, grasslands, oceans and natural cultural relics, and expand the scope of resource taxes, which would be used for the ecological protection compensation.
Calling for continuous promotion of ecological compensation pilot areas, the document also asked to set a bottom line for ecological protection, and work out ecological compensation policies. 
It also called for improvement of compensation policies for forbidden development zones such as national natural reserves, world cultural relics, national scenic spots, national forestry parks, and national geological parks. 
The document urged working out a compensation mechanism that mainly depends on local compensation while receiving financial support from the central government.
It encouraged the protection areas and benefited areas, lower reaches and upper reaches of the same river to set up a horizontal compensation payment relationship through funds compensation, coordination, industry transfer, talent training and co-building of industrial parks.

			China to revitalize the northeast






Updated:
Apr 27,2016 8:58 AM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China will rejuvenate its northeast rustbelt region through more reforms and economic restructuring, according to a policy document released April 26.
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) will be restructured, private firms will receive more support and regional cooperation will drive development, according to the document jointly published by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council.
The region’s equipment manufacturing sector will be modernized, and high-end industries, the modern service sector and modern agriculture will all be supported, it said.
The northeast, including Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, was among the first regions in China to become industrialized. Its traditional industries include steel, automobile, shipbuilding, aircraft manufacturing and petroleum refining.
However, this once robust industrial base is bearing the brunt of a more-acute slowdown than the rest of the country, trailing well behind in terms of GDP growth.
Expediting the revitalization of the northeast, a major “pole” of China’s economic growth, is a significant part of the country’s modernization drive and overall economic restructuring, the document added.
The renewed action plan is reminiscent of a revitalization strategy rolled out by the central government in 2003, including a slew of supportive measures specially designed for the region.
The document, “Certain Opinions Regarding the Comprehensive Revival of Old Industrial Bases Including the Northeast,” called the new strategy a “major policy for the new century,” adding that this period would be crucial for reviving the region.
The region is experiencing growing downward pressure on growth while SOEs are lacking in vitality, according to the document.
By 2020, industries in recession and regions with dwindling resources should have transformed their growth patterns.
The region should have achieved medium-high growth, and should have met the target of building a moderately prosperous society by 2020, the document said.
In another ten years, northeast China should become the manufacturing base for advanced equipment and a strategic base for technological equipment. The region should become synonymous with new raw materials, modern agriculture and innovation.
Local governments should work to create an open and fair business environment and unleash economic vitality through eased approval procedures, the delegating of power to lower levels and improving services, according to the document.
The document called on local governments to improve SOE mechanisms and provide a favorable environment to make SOEs more competitive and an integral part of the regional revitalization drive.
SOEs should take the lead and seek efficiency through technology, restructuring and better management.
The development of the private sector will also be encouraged, with financing services for small and medium-sized businesses to be improved and investment access for private capital to be relaxed.
In addition, regional cooperation with northeast Asia, the Silk Road economic belt and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region will be stepped up.
The region should promote the development of advanced equipment manufacturing, in sectors including electricity, petrochemistry, mining, engineering, aviation and shipping, the document said.
The equipment manufactured by the northeastern provinces will not only be distributed on the domestic market, but the export of these products will be prioritized, too, it said. Guidance and support should be offered to steer industries from manufacturing to production-based services. The region should also develop the financial sector, modern logistics, as well as tourism and leisure sectors.
The northeastern region should make the most of the government’s innovation and entrepreneurship drive to turn innovation into a major source of development, according to the document.
To promote innovation, the document underscored the need to establish an effective system for incubating regional innovation, integrating scientific and educational institutions into regional development, as well as talent training and introduction.
“The starting point — and the ultimate goal of revitalizing the northeastern industrial bases — is safeguarding and improving people’s lives,” according to the document, adding that the government must make sure tangible benefits are shared by all people.
The document also pinpointed tasks to improve social security net, add more jobs, upgrade urban public services and make the environment more livable.

			Quality upgrades to help structural reform






Updated:

	    english.gov.cn












To improve the quality and efficiency in development, the State Council on April 19 issued a circular, presenting the quality improvement action plans for supply-side structural reform in 2016. 
The circular put forward a series of measures to improve quality and branding, including carrying out related operations, optimizing the environment, fostering competitive advantages as well as enhancing the legal system.
According to the circular, governments at all levels should take actions to increase motivation for quality and brand upgrades, carry out operations that focus on products with public concerns and foods for export, enhance the vocational skills of laborers, drive technical innovation in key areas, and encourage adopting an advanced management system and standards.
Brand construction was emphasized as a requirement in the circular, which asks for governments at all levels to formulate a 13th Five-Year Plan, improving national standards for brands and helping enterprises strengthen brand construction. Furthermore, they will direct the international standards development and help Chinese brands go global.
Meanwhile, the circular said that governments are responsible for a better environment in which quality and branding can get upgrades.
The actions are presented to clean out any outdated production facilities and cut industrial capacity in areas including coal and steel, electrolytic aluminum and petrochemical industries.
Efforts to strengthen supervision and regulation in key sectors are also required. Governments should step up developing the tracking system for important products, and heavily regulate and supervise food safety in schools, the quality of daily necessities and drinking water.
The circular also called for the development of a quality credibility system, with an information sharing system built to collect and integrate credit information concerning product quality, intellectual property, water projects, highways and waterways, travel companies and offshore production of imported and exported foods.
The government and society are expected to jointly carry out a national “quality month 2016” campaign, driving the entire society to improve quality and foster better brands, the circular said.
In addition, the circular also stressed that performance reviews should be conducted and that the news media supervision and publicity should be given full play.
New competitive advantages can be acquired through keeping quality imports and quality exports in foreign trade areas and promoting the quality of e-commerce businesses, the circular said.
Furthermore, the legal system should be improved to lay a solid foundation for quality and brand upgrades.
The circular calls on governments at all levels to keep leading and coordinating the brand and quality improvement operations, fulfill the responsibility and ensure the completion of this year’s tasks.

			State Council highlights key tasks in 2016 legislative work






Updated:
Apr 13,2016 4:54 PM
	    english.gov.cn












Legislative projects related to tasks in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and in this year’s government work report are being given the highest priority in the legislative work of 2016, according to a recent circular issued by the State Council.
The circular put forward specific suggestions on fulfilling this year’s legislative work. It stressed promoting development featuring innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing.
The circular said that efforts should be made to speed up the introduction of innovation-friendly regulations concerning market environment, property rights system, investment and financing system and talent introduction and training, and improve rules on protection of intellectual property rights.
Meanwhile, coordinated development between urban and rural areas, between the economy and society, and between industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agriculture modernization should also be enhanced.
In addition, the circular said the introduction of regulations and rules should be favorable to energy conservation and efficient use of energy, to promote low-carbon development and strengthen environmental management and ecological protection.
Moreover, laws and regulations concerning foreign affairs should also be improved to create a transparent, fair and just business environment. 
The legitimate rights and interests of the public in all fields should also be safeguarded, the circular said. 
In addition, the introduction of legislation should also be conducive to deepening reform and streamlining administration, the circular emphasized.
Misconduct in legislative work, such as power abuse and responsibility evasion, should be avoided to prevent the legislation work from becoming a tool to seek improper interests and benefits.
All legislative work concerning the reform plans clearly specified by the Party and the State Council should be completed through various methods as soon as possible to elevate a successful outcome.
Focusing on public concerns, the number of administrative approval items should be further reduced to enhance administration streamlining and power delegation and release market vitality and social creativity. Supervision and management measures should be mapped out for canceled and delegated administrative approval items. The adoption of new administrative approval items should be strictly controlled and those that really need new administrative permission should be examined from the aspects of legitimacy, rationality and necessity.
Any rules and regulations going against stable economic growth, reform initiatives, structural adjustment, people’s livelihood, risk control and entrepreneurship and innovation, should be modified or abolished, the circular stressed.
