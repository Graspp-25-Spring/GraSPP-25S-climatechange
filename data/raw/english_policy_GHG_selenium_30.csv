The guideline is jointly issued by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council.
The guideline outlines measures to deepen reforms in the trading of resources and environmental factors, including improving quota allocation systems, expanding the scope of tradable elements, strengthening trading mechanisms, and enhancing foundational capacities.
By 2027, China aims to establish basically sound trading systems for carbon emission rights and water use rights, while further refining mechanisms for the trading of pollutant discharge rights, per the guideline.
By then, the market-based energy-saving mechanism will be further improved, and the trading of resource and environmental factors will become more active, supported by a better price formation mechanism, according to the guideline.
Despite resource scarcity and limited environmental capacity -- China's fundamental conditions -- the country has made significant strides in addressing these constraints through market-based mechanisms, according to an official of the National Development and Reform Commission.
China has established a national carbon market, a voluntary greenhouse gas emissions reduction market and a water right trade exchange, while also piloting various local trading schemes to promote the market-based allocation of resources and environmental factors.
The new guideline is expected to help direct the orderly flows of resources and environmental factors toward green and low-carbon development, and to support the cultivation of new quality productive forces, the official said.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,3,7,2,7,1,0
China doubles down on urban upgrades to boost high-quality development,https://english.www.gov.cn/policies/latestreleases/202505/15/content_WS6825eef2c6d0868f4e8f2923.html,2025-05-15,True,environment,"BEIJING, May 15 -- China is intensifying efforts to advance its urban renewal initiative as it strives to build livable, resilient and smart cities, and to bolster high-quality development.
In its latest push, the country on Thursday unveiled a set of guidelines, pledging increased policy and financial support for urban renewal projects, which can range from gas pipe updates and lift installations to the renovation of old factories into commercial zones.
The guidelines, issued by the general offices of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council, are designed to achieve key progress in the country's urban renewal campaign by 2030. They also aim to improve safety conditions, enhance service efficiency, elevate living environments, develop business models, and preserve cultural heritage.
Efforts should be focused on reinforcing and renovating existing buildings as well as old residential areas, while optimizing their infrastructure, including parking, charging, fire protection and communication.
The update and renovation of old commercial blocks, factory areas and urban villages will be advanced, according to the guidelines, which also urged establishing multi-level and all-coverage public service networks to meet people's living needs.
The guidelines also called for accelerating the construction and renovation of gas, water supply, drainage, sewage, heat supply along with other underground pipeline networks and underground utility tunnels, while strengthening the construction of public fire protection facilities, and improving transportation infrastructure.
They also established requirements on restoring the ecological system in cities, and preserving urban history and culture.
In the meantime, an urban renewal implementation mechanism should be established, while the land use policy should be optimized, the guidelines said, adding that a whole-life-cycle housing safety management system needs to be created.
The latest document came as Chinese authorities issued a slew of measures to upgrade urban areas.
The country initiated over 60,000 urban renewal projects in 2024, with a total investment of 2.9 trillion yuan (about 402.8 billion U.S. dollars).

The renovation of old residential communities, blocks, factory areas and urban villages in cities should be accelerated, and the renovation of urban infrastructure should be strengthened, the meeting noted.
In April, the Ministry of Finance pledged central budget support for the urban renewal initiative in up to 20 cities over the course of this year, noting that priority will be given to mega and super large cities, as well as large cities along key river basins such as the Yellow River and the Pearl River.
Municipalities, along with cities in the country's western regions, can each receive up to 1.2 billion yuan in subsidies for upgrade projects.

China unveils plan on special initiatives to boost consumption,https://english.www.gov.cn/policies/latestreleases/202503/16/content_WS67d6b21bc6d0868f4e8f0da0.html,2025-03-16,True,environment,"BEIJING, March 16 -- China on Sunday made public a plan on special initiatives to increase consumption, as the world's second-largest economy moves to make domestic demand the main engine and anchor of economic growth.
The plan, issued by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council, aims to vigorously boost consumption, stimulate domestic demand across the board, and increase spending power by raising earnings and reducing financial burdens.
It also aims to generate effective demand through high-quality supply, improve the consumption environment to strengthen consumer willingness to spend, and address prominent constraints on consumption.
The plan, organized into eight major sections, adopts a holistic approach by simultaneously addressing factors such as income growth, service consumption quality enhancement, big-ticket consumption upgrading, and consumption environment improvement.
The plan aims to promote reasonable wage growth by strengthening employment support in response to economic conditions and improving the minimum wage adjustment mechanisms. China will expand property income channels through measures to stabilize the stock market and develop more bond products suitable for individual investors.
The plan calls for exploring ways to unlock the values of houses legally owned by farmers through rental arrangements, equity participation and cooperative models.
Notably, the plan emphasizes both traditional consumption sectors like housing and automobiles, alongside emerging categories such as artificial intelligence-powered products, low-altitude economy and silver tourism.
China will accelerate the development and application of new technologies and products including autonomous driving, smart wearables, ultra-high-definition video, brain-computer interfaces, robotics and additive manufacturing, more commonly known as 3D printing, to create new high-growth consumption sectors.
These measures reveal a geographically nuanced approach, with targeted policies for rural areas, regions rich in ice and snow resources, and urban centers -- allowing local authorities flexibility via implementation based on regional conditions.
Support will be given to ice and snow resource-rich regions to help them develop into globally recognized winter tourism destinations. The plan also emphasizes developing inbound consumption by systematically expanding unilateral visa-free arrangements and optimizing regional visa-free entry policies.
By connecting consumer spending to broader social goals like elderly care improvement, childcare support and work-life balance, the plan embeds consumption growth within China's wider development objectives, signaling that consumption is being positioned not just as an economic target but as a means to enhance quality of life.
Accordingly, China will consider establishing a childcare subsidy system. It will guide eligible regions to include individuals in flexible employment, rural migrant workers, and those in new forms of employment who are covered by the basic medical insurance for employees, in the country's childbirth insurance program.
Regarding elderly care, the country will in 2025 increase the fiscal subsidies for basic old-age benefits and basic medical insurance for rural and non-working urban residents. Additionally, basic pension benefits for retirees will be appropriately raised.
The country will work to strictly implement the paid annual leave system -- ensuring that workers' rights to rest and vacation are legally protected. It will also prohibit the unlawful extension of working hours.
Financial institutions will be encouraged to increase the issuance of personal consumption loans, provided risks are controllable. They should reasonably set loan limits, terms and interest rates, according to the plan.
Zou Yunhan, a researcher with the State Information Center, said consumption is playing an increasingly important role in boosting economic growth, but that some challenges still remain in the quest to further unlock consumer potential.
Looking ahead, Zou called for collective efforts from all sectors to fully implement the action plan and ensure its effectiveness. ""Driven by innovation and supportive policy initiatives, China's consumer market is poised for steady growth this year. New opportunities are emerging, which will provide a strong impetus for the country's high-quality economic development.""",3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0

Efforts should be intensified to attract investment in key sectors. The plan said that foreign businesses are encouraged to invest in animal husbandry-related fields such as breeding, feeding equipment production and production of feed and veterinary medicine, and such investors can enjoy national treatment.
Measures will be made to support foreign-invested enterprises to participate in China's new industrialization processes, with a focus on attracting foreign investment in high-tech fields to provide more market opportunities and cooperation space for foreign-invested enterprises.
Service sectors such as elderly care services, culture and tourism, sports, health care, vocational education, and finance are encouraged to attract and utilize foreign investment to meet diverse service consumption demands.
Meanwhile, the external publicity and promotion of economic policies and the business environment should be strengthened.

China unveils blueprint for building strong education system by 2035,https://english.www.gov.cn/policies/latestreleases/202501/20/content_WS678d85c6c6d0868f4e8eef83.html,2025-01-20,True,"carbon emissions, carbon, environment, emission, emissions","BEIJING, Jan. 19 -- China on Sunday unveiled a new educational blueprint, vowing to build a strong education system by 2035 to support its modernization drive and national rejuvenation.
The 2024-2035 master plan on building China into a leading country in education was jointly issued by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council.
The strong education system of socialism with Chinese characteristics will feature powerful ideological and political leadership, talent competitiveness, scientific and technological underpinning, livelihood security, social synergy, and international influence, according to the document.
Building a leading country in education has been an aspiration of the Chinese nation since the advent of modern times. In 2022, the CPC set the goal to be achieved by 2035.
By 2027, a high-quality education system is expected to be initially established, and independent cultivation of talent will be greatly improved, leading to a steady stream of outstanding, innovative individuals, according to the document.
By 2035, a high-quality education system will be fully established. The accessibility and quality of basic education will remain among the best in the world. A fully developed learning society will be in place, and overall educational modernization will be achieved, it added.
This is the first national action plan focused on building China into a leading country in education to support the country's modernization in all respects.
HIGHER EDUCATION
According to the document, China will accelerate the development of advanced research universities, encourage high-level foreign universities in science and engineering to offer programs in China, and vigorously promote professional postgraduate degree programs.
A mechanism needs to be put in place to adjust disciplines and majors in alignment with advancements in science and technology as well as the country's national strategies, said the document.
It called for extraordinary efforts to set up urgently needed disciplines and majors, and stressed the need to strengthen foundational, emerging and interdisciplinary disciplines, and support endangered and less popular disciplines. The country will implement plans for foundational and interdisciplinary breakthrough research.
The document stressed that China will foster an environment that encourages exploration and tolerates failure, with the goal of cultivating high-caliber faculty and master scholars, according to the document.
Wu Yan, vice minister of education, revealed at a press conference last September that China added 1,673 undergraduate programs urgently needed for national strategies and removed 1,670 that do not align with economic and social development in 2024, an adjustment he described as ""unprecedented.""
Among the new majors are intelligent maritime equipment, intelligent material technology, and interdisciplinary engineering. For example, South China University of Technology was the first to apply to offer programs in soft matter science and engineering major and intelligent maritime equipment.
These are two majors designed to support the upgrading of China's strategic industries and the development of high-tech industries in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.
There are 1,308 undergraduate universities in China, offering 816 majors across 93 subcategories within 12 categories. Since 2012, educational authorities have added 21,000 undergraduate programs and canceled or suspended 12,000, according to the ministry.
OPENING UP
The new educational blueprint devoted significant attention to opening up. China will enhance its capacity to train and attract global talent, expand youth exchanges between China and other countries, and implement international summer school programs.
Wu said at the September press conference that China will launch 800 key international summer school projects in the next three years. Additionally, it will invite 50,000 American teenagers to China for exchange programs over the next five years and 10,000 French teenagers in the next three years.
Notably, the country will expand academic exchanges and educational and research cooperation with the rest of the world, while supporting its universities in initiating and participating in international scientific programs, according to the document.
Chinese scientists have taken the lead in international high-profile projects including the Deep-time Digital Earth and Ocean Negative Carbon Emissions.
China will also actively participate in global education governance and support the establishment and development of international STEM education institutions.
The Sunday document also highlighted the need to monitor demographic shifts across different school-age groups in basic education, advance high-quality, balanced development and urban-rural integration in compulsory education, and cultivate more master craftsmen and highly-skilled workers.",4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0

According to the recently issued guidelines, the main objectives are that by 2030, the country will achieve ""remarkable results"" in the green transition in all areas of economic and social development; and by 2035, a green, low-carbon, and circular development economic system will be basically established and the goal of Beautiful China will be basically achieved.
The guidelines have raised a raft of work tasks such as optimizing the development and protection of territorial space, promoting the green and low-carbon transition in industrial structure and the energy sector, as well as promoting green transition in the transport sector and urban-rural development.
The guidelines also put forward quantitative work goals for different fields. By 2030, the scale of the energy conservation and environmental protection industry in the country will reach about 15 trillion yuan (about 2.1 trillion U.S. dollars), the proportion of non-fossil energy will increase to about 25 percent of energy consumption, and the installed capacity of pumped storage hydropower will exceed 120 million kilowatts.
By 2030, the carbon emission intensity of commercial transport per unit of turnover will drop by about 9.5 percent compared with 2020, and the annual utilization of bulk solid waste will reach about 4.5 billion tonnes, with the output rate of main resources to increase by about 45 percent compared with 2020, according to the guidelines.
According to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the guidelines were issued at a time when China has made historical achievements in green and low-carbon development since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012.
For instance, as of the end of June 2024, the installed capacity of renewable energy has reached 1.653 billion kW, accounting for 53.8 percent of the country's total installed capacity. In 2023, the nation's energy consumption and carbon emission intensity per unit of GDP dropped by more than 26 percent and 35 percent, respectively, compared with 2012, it said.
However, the NDRC said China still faces difficulties and challenges in green transition, with the energy structure remaining biased toward coal and the proportion of fossil energy and traditional industries remaining high in the country. ""In addition, the global green transition is facing setbacks, environmental and climate issues are increasingly being politicized, and green trade barriers are escalating.""
The guidelines will be of great significance to promote the green transition of the development model, comprehensively promote the construction of a beautiful China, and achieve high-quality development, according to the NDRC.
The guidelines also highlight green transition in the consumption model by encouraging people to pursue green and healthy life. They also aim to boost green consumption by expanding the scope and scale of government procurement of green products, promoting trade-in programs to boost consumer spending on green products, and carrying out marketing campaigns for new energy vehicles and green home appliances in rural regions.
According to the guidelines, the country will pursue fiscal and taxation policies that are conducive to promoting green and low-carbon development and the efficient use of resources.
In terms of financial instruments, China will extend the implementation period of carbon emission reduction support tools to the end of 2027 and actively develop financial instruments such as green equity financing, green financial leasing, and green trusts.
In terms of investment mechanisms, investment within the central budget will actively support key projects, and the government will encourage and regulate the participation of social capital in green and low-carbon projects, according to the guidelines.",9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,2,3,2,0,0

Hydrogen is a secondary source of energy that usually requires a primary energy input to be produced on an industrial scale. Depending on the source from which it is produced, hydrogen can be gray, blue or green, and green hydrogen is the only type produced in a climate-neutral manner that could reduce emissions.
Globally, hydrogen has become an important strategic choice for major developed economies seeking to accelerate their energy transformation and upgrading.
