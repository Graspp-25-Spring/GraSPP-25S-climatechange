New negative list to further encourage foreign investment,https://english.www.gov.cn/policies/latestreleases/201907/09/content_WS5d247a78c6d03ce67879a283.html,2019-07-09,True,"environment, environmental","A new negative list for foreign investment prior to entry in China is cutting the number of prohibited sectors and subsectors to 40 from 190 in 2013, the fifth time the list has been shortened in the last six years.
Called the Special Administrative Measures (Negative list) for Access of Foreign Investment (2019 Revision), the list was published by the National Development and Reform Commission on June 30 and will be implemented on July 30.
The new revision is aimed at easing curbs on foreign investment and widening access for foreign investment to agriculture, mining, manufacturing and service industries.
Any foreign market entity that’s not on the list can enter the country’s market on an equal footing with Chinese firms, a principle being strictly implemented by the Ministry of Commerce.
MOFCOM is eliminating all restrictions other than those on the negative list and will continue to simplify the approval process for foreign-invested enterprises and delegate the power of approval to lower-level governments, said Tang Wenhong, head of the Department of Foreign Investment Administration at MOFCOM.
China shortened the negative list last year, easing curbs on 22 sectors including automobiles, general aviation, banking, securities and insurance. The number then shrank to 48, with three-fourths of 2011’s list canceled.
Meng Wei, spokesman for the NDRC, said the negative list is intended to simplify instead of adding extra rules. He noted the country is looking to completely cancel all restrictive rules not on the negative list before 2019 ends, and will implement more encouraging measures for industries where foreign investment has flown, especially in central and western China. Services for major foreign-funded projects will be continued.
The international community is paying close attention to the release of the negative list. Reuters commented on the move, saying China never stalls on its way to further open up. United Press International said this marks a significant change amid China’s reform on key industries, for which it will allow more foreign investment to come in.
Since the 19th National Congress of the CPC, China has been implementing policies of high-quality development to liberalize and facilitate investment, in efforts to build up all-around opening-up.
According to a recent report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, cross-border direct investment global-wise has fallen for three consecutive years from $1.9 trillion in 2015 to $1.3 trillion in 2018, the lowest since the financial crisis in 2008. This has posed challenges for all countries in attracting foreign investment.
In 2018, China’s foreign trade reached a record high despite a global atmosphere where foreign investment is shrinking overall, said Chu Shijia, director of the Comprehensive Department at the MOFCOM.
He pointed out China’s foreign trade and investment have maintained steady growth on the basis of last year’s high volume, indicating great resilience in China’s economy.
On the whole, there are grounds for China’s foreign trade and investment to sustain and grow steadily, he added, mentioning this will be the case in the future as well.
Gao Feng, spokesman for the MOFCOM, said the 2018 negative list has been implemented in various areas, especially pilot free trade zones, and received high recognition as it significantly improved the transparency of foreign investment, as well as facilitated and standardized operations. He also noted the market’s innovation vitality and forces to drive economic development were further stimulated by a better business environment.
Published at the same time were two other indicators of China’s opening-up: The Catalogue of Encouraged Foreign Investment Industries (2019 Revision) and the Catalogue of Advantageous Industries for Foreign Investment in Central and West China. They are listed to boost intensive measures to attract foreign investment in fields such as modern farming, advanced manufacturing, high-tech, energy saving and environmental protection, as well as the modern service industry.
Meanwhile, the newly enacted Foreign Investment Law will guarantee a stronger legal base for foreign investment. MOFCOM is coordinating existing laws, regulations and normative documents to go in line with it. Provisions that are inconsistent with the Foreign Investment Law will be abolished or revised, so as to ensure successful implementation of the law on Jan 1.",63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0

Updated:

	    Xinhua










BEIJING —  The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council, or China’s Cabinet, announced guidelines on the promotion of integrated urban-rural development on May 5.China has made great headway in advancing urbanization and balancing development between rural and urban areas since the 18th National Congress of the CPC. However, barriers hindering integrated urban-rural development still exist.The guidelines are aimed at eradicating such barriers to promote rural revitalization and speeding up the modernization of agriculture and rural areas.The systems and mechanisms for promoting integrated urban-rural development should begin to take shape by 2022. The country will also gradually eliminate restrictions on urban settlement, according to the guidelines.China aims to put in place more sound systems and mechanisms for promoting integrated urban-rural development by 2035. The urban-rural gap in development and living standards will be remarkably reduced.By the middle of the century, China will meet the goal of realizing the comprehensive integration of urban-rural areas and rural revitalization and basically realize the target of achieving shared prosperity for everyone.To achieve these ambitious goals, China will break barriers that restrict the free flow of resources — such as capital, talents, information — between urban and rural areas, and inject new impetus to the countryside.China will deepen household registration reforms, relax restrictions on urban settlement except for several mega-cities, promote coordinated development between cities and towns, as well as increase the population carrying capacity and attractiveness of mid- and small-sized cities.The country will also make cities more inclusive and help migrant workers settle into city life.China will implement incentive policies to attract talents to work or start businesses in rural areas.The country will continue to deepen and improve rural land reform and allow farmers to turn their land-use rights into shares in farming enterprises or cooperatives.China will also improve financial services in rural areas, and support the issuance of government bonds by local authorities to finance public welfare projects on integrated urban-rural development.Considering that public services are weak in rural areas, China will establish and improve its systems and mechanisms to channel more resources there.China will establish a mechanism to balance the allocation of educational resources and prioritize developing education in rural areas.Provincial-level governments are encouraged to build a supplementary mechanism for unified selection of rural teachers and send more outstanding college graduates to rural schools.The country will improve the medical and health service system in rural areas, efforts will be made to increase the attractiveness of grassroots medical jobs and training of rural medical workers will be strengthened.China will also improve the public cultural service system and channel more cultural resources to rural areas. Cultural workers and volunteers are encouraged to participate in the cultural development in rural areas.The guidelines also call for improving the unified urban and rural social security system, coordinating urban and rural social assistance systems and establishing rural governance mechanisms.Institution and mechanism will be established to promote the integrated development of urban and rural infrastructure, with priority given to rural areas.To promote diversified economic development in rural area, the country will continue to protect its agriculture, establish a cultivation mechanism for new industries and build a platform for integrated development of urban and rural industries.The country will also expand the channels to raise farmers’ income and constantly narrow the gap in the living standard of urban and rural residents.Employment discrimination will be eliminated, more jobs created and business opportunities increased to form an environment for promoting income increase for farmers, according to the guidelines.

The State Council issued regulations for online government services on April 30, effective immediately. The regulations were made to further standardize and facilitate government services to provide efficient and convenient services for people and enterprises, and improve the business environment. According to the document, China will step up efforts to build a nationwide integrated online government service platform with a unified standard for all government service items, through which services of different departments in different regions will be standardized and connected. And a data sharing system and all required procedures will be provided. The integrated platform will consist of government service platforms of the central government, departments of the State Council and local governments. The document also said the General Office of the State Council will take the lead in building the integrated platform, and will facilitate the establishment of standards, security, and management systems. Authorities at provincial, autonomous regional, municipal levels and related departments of the State Council will take charge of building service platforms. Also, they need to be responsible for security guarantees and management of the platforms. Government service items, unless required by laws or regulations or involve state secrets, should be included in the integrated online platform.

BEIJING — China has unveiled a guideline to facilitate the sound development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).As a major impetus for economic and social development, SMEs make contributions to increasing employment, improving people’s livelihood and promoting entrepreneurship and innovation, said the guideline jointly released by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council.Therefore, the guideline called for more attention to the problems impeding further growth of SMEs, such as rising costs, financing difficulties and inadequate innovation capability.To solve such problems, the country will improve the business environment for SMEs by further broadening market access, simplifying administrative procedures and strengthening market supervision and regulation, according to the guideline.Meanwhile, more measures will be launched to relieve SMEs’ financing difficulties, including cutting targeted reserve requirement ratio for inclusive financing, creating more financing channels and encouraging SMEs to receive financing on the “new third board.”While readjusting tax policies to support the financing of SMEs and reducing their tax burdens, the country will increase financial support for innovation and entrepreneurship and consolidate the protection of intellectual property.In addition, the guideline urged related institutions to enhance public services and accelerate the establishment of credit information sharing platforms for SMEs.

			China takes advantage of Beijing 2022 to push winter sports 





Updated:
Apr 1,2019 6:41 AM
	    Xinhua










BEIJING — The Chinese government issued the “Guidance on Taking the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics as an Opportunity to Develop Winter Sports” on March 31, trying to seize the opportunity of the Olympics to usher winter sports into a new level. The guidance lists main goals of China’s winter sports by 2022, including that the development of winter sports in China will be more balanced; popularity will be significantly improved; participation will increase by a large margin, and the influence will be more extensive.According to the guidance, China will compete in all events at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games, and will improve athletes’ competitiveness, thus ensuring breakthroughs in performance.The guidance stresses the importance of preparation for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games.To provide better facilities, related departments and institutions should push forward scientific research, set “green channel” for procurement of training equipment and construction projects for the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics, optimize procurement procedures, and improve procurement efficiency.To ensure a well-rounded environment for training, authorities should undertake training and supporting tasks when conditions permit, strengthen the construction of training venues and facilities for national teams, and speed up the establishment of the training and supporting team.To build an incentive mechanism, local governments should formulate education and settlement policies after retiring that conform to the characteristics of winter sports athletes, ensure the treatment and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of athletes, coaches, and other personnel to address their concerns and better prepare for the Beijing Winter Olympics.The guidance shows the Chinese government’s determination to popularize mass winter sports. Local governments should perfect the system, construct more facilities, diversify sports activities, strengthen publicity, and carry out extensive activities for youth such as sports events and school activities.The guidance also calls for the development of winter sports industry.First, cultivate the main body of the market. Local governments should implement the brand strategy, establish industrial areas with relatively large scales, develop companies with relatively large influence and strong market competitiveness, and build composite bases for tourism and sports.Second, optimize industrial structure. Local governments should promote the fitness, leisure, and tourism industry, integrate winter sports industry and related industries, and provide diversified products and services. Local governments should innovate in the manufacturing industry of winter sports equipment and promote synergy between upstream and downstream of the industrial chain. High-tech enterprises with independent intellectual property will be strongly supported.Third, expand the market of competition and performance. Local governments should arrange the bid for holding international high-level sports events in an orderly manner. For highly spectacular winter sports such as figure skating, ice hockey, curling, snowboarding and short track speed skating, local governments should support social forces to create high-quality events and activities.Also, they should support the application of new technologies such as ultra-high definition video and virtual reality in the live broadcasting and relay of winter sports events, thus developing related industries at the same time.

			China unveils development plan for Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area





Updated:
Feb 18,2019 7:35 PM
	    Xinhua










BEIJING — Chinese authorities unveiled the outline development plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area on Feb 18, aiming to develop the region into “a role model of high-quality development.”The plan was released by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.Promoting the development of the Greater Bay Area is a major decision made by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, said an official in charge of the office of the leading group for developing the area.“It is a national strategy General Secretary Xi Jinping has planned for, made decisions about and promoted in person,” the official said.STRATEGIC ROLEThe bay area consists of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR), as well as nine cities in Guangdong province — Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing.Covering a total area of 56,000 square kilometers, the bay area had a combined population of about 70 million at the end of 2017 and its gross domestic product reached around 10 trillion yuan ($1.48 trillion) in 2017.“As one of the most open and economically vibrant regions in China, the Greater Bay Area plays a significant strategic role in the overall development of the country,” says the plan.The development of the area is hailed not only as a new attempt to break new ground in pursuing opening-up on all fronts in a new era, but also a further step in taking forward the practice of “one country, two systems.”The plan covers the period from now to 2022 in the immediate term and extends to 2035 in the long term.The plan has 11 chapters: the background, the overall requirements, the spatial layout, developing an international innovation and technology hub, expediting infrastructural connectivity, building a globally competitive modern industrial system, taking forward ecological conservation, developing a quality living circle for living, working and traveling, strengthening cooperation and jointly participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, jointly developing Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao cooperation platforms, and the implementation of the plan.WORLD-CLASS CITY CLUSTERThe plan says the bay area will be turned into a vibrant world-class city cluster, a globally influential international innovation and technology hub, an important support pillar for the Belt and Road Initiative, a showcase for in-depth cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao, and a quality living circle for living, working and traveling.Efforts should be made to build on the four core cities of Hong Kong, Macao, Guangzhou and Shenzhen as core engines for regional development, continue leveraging their comparative advantages in striving for excellence and achievements, and strengthen the radiating effect in leading the development of nearby regions.Setting development objectives, the plan says by 2022 the framework should essentially be formed for an international first-class bay area and world-class city cluster that is vibrant and highly innovative with an optimized industrial structure, a smooth flow of various factors and a pleasant ecological environment.By 2035, the bay area should have an economic system and a mode of development mainly supported by innovation, with its economic and technological strengths vastly increased and its international competitiveness and influence further strengthened, it adds.By then, the markets within the Greater Bay Area should basically be highly connected, with a very effective and efficient flow of various resources and factors of production; the coordination of regional development should remarkably improve, with the influence on neighboring regions further strengthened.The people should become wealthier; the level of social civility should reach new heights, with cultural soft power demonstrably strengthened, Chinese cultural influence broadened and deepened, and exchange and integration between different cultures further enhanced, the plan says.Meanwhile, the levels of conservation and efficient use of resources should be significantly improved, the ecological environment should be effectively protected, and an international first-class bay area for living, working and traveling should be fully developed.PLAN HAILEDThe People’s Daily hailed the plan, saying the Greater Bay Area facilitates the enrichment of the implementation of the “one country, two systems,” creates more opportunities for the socio-economic development of the two special administrative regions and for Hong Kong and Macao compatriots wishing to develop careers on the mainland.We must “free our minds, make active explorations and bold trials, and strive to play a pioneering role,” the article says.Both HKSAR and Macao SAR governments issued statements welcoming the promulgation of the plan.An HKSAR government spokesperson said the Greater Bay Area will help Hong Kong find new drivers for economic growth and advance the diversified development of local economy and industries, as well as expand the living and development space of Hong Kong residents.“Bay areas play a big role in global economic powerhouses such as the United States and Japan,” said Liang Haiming, head of China Silk Road iValley Research Institute. “China’s bay area will become a world-leading one and demonstrate the vitality of our systems.”Lin Jiang, vice-dean with the Center for Studies of Hong Kong, Macao and Pearl River Delta at Sun Yat-sen University, noted the complexity of building this bay area because different social and legal systems, three separate customs territories and three currencies are involved.“Such uniqueness brings challenges,” Lin said, but adding that they can be overcome by improving the unified mechanism of regional public goods.Ip Kuai Peng, pro-rector of the City University of Macau, said he is confident that the Greater Bay Area will evolve into a vibrant, innovative world-class area with high efficiency, rich resources, a strong economy, and good opportunities.“The high degree of resource flow and integration in the area will truly enhance the well-being of Macao residents,” he said. “For example, the ‘one-hour living circle’ will greatly facilitate the life and employment of bay area residents.”Fang Zhou, research director of the Hong Kong-based One-Country-Two-Systems Research Institute, said developing the bay area will provide young people with new opportunities.It will allow Hong Kong residents to further enjoy the benefits of the country’s economic development and sustain Hong Kong’s long-term prosperity and stability, he said.

	    Xinhua










BEIJING — Agriculture, rural areas and farmer’s issues remain China’s top priorities for the 16th consecutive year as its “No 1 central document” prioritizes development of agriculture and rural areas.The document, the first policy statement released by central authorities each year and seen as an indicator of policy priorities, was made public on Feb 19 by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council.“This year and the next will mark a decisive period for completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and quite a few tough tasks must be fulfilled in the fields relating to agriculture, rural areas and rural people,” the document said.“Unswerving efforts must be made to ensure that addressing the issues relating to agriculture, rural areas and rural people enjoy a central place on the work agenda of the CPC.“The country should consolidate the sound momentum for agricultural and rural development, capitalize on the role of agriculture, rural areas and rural people as the ballast stone, and win the upper hand in effectively handling risks and challenges.”Work must be done to deepen agricultural supply-side structural reform, win the tough battle against poverty, give full play to the key role of rural primary-level Party organizations, and push forward rural vitalization in all respects, according to the document.In doing so, the country will ensure the fulfillment of goals and tasks for rural reform and development by 2020, it added.Existent policies will be fully implemented to ensure the country’s poverty elimination targets being realized — to lift all its rural residents living below current poverty line out of poverty and eliminate poverty in all poor counties and regions by 2020.Focus will be put on providing assistance to areas of extreme poverty, via favorable policies ranging from major projects, poor resident relocation, finance and nurturing of talent.The country vowed to solve prominent problems involving poverty reduction, and pledged consistent efforts to crack down on corruption and misconduct, according to the document.The document noted that the country will strive to ensure effective supply of major agricultural products. Efforts will be made to ensure that grain planting area remains steady at 1.65 billion mu (110 million hectares) and arable land area is kept above 1.8 billion mu, as well as develop 800 million mu of high-standard farmland by 2020.It said the country will move to optimize agricultural structure, boost production of green agricultural products or those in short supply, and roll out plans to increase soybean planting and support dairy industry.The country vowed to step up breakthrough in key agricultural core technologies, and promote independent innovation in areas including biological breeding, heavy agricultural machinery, smart agriculture and green agricultural inputs.The document also noted the country will enhance agricultural cooperation with countries along the Belt and Road, actively expand imports of agricultural products in short supply at home, diversify importing channels, and foster the development of multinational agricultural corporations.Progress should be made to promote rural development as well as improve rural living environments and public services such as education, healthcare, social security, elderly care and culture.The country will take measures to improve rural infrastructure including roads, grids and logistics network, as well as enhance pollution treatment and environmental protection.According to the document, the country will foster the development of rural industries and diversify channels to increase the income of farmers.It stressed developing industries with local characteristics, modern agricultural product processing and new rural services. The country will also push forward a digital countryside strategy.The country should improve employment services and vocational training to promote the employment of the rural labor force and increase their incomes, the document said.China will encourage rural migrant workers, college graduates, veterans and urban personnel to make innovations and start businesses in rural areas, and support the building of service platforms to encourage business startups.Efforts will be stepped up to build a new policy system for agricultural subsidies, according to the document, which said the country would formulate and improve agriculture support and protection policies following principles that comply with World Trade Organization rules, protect farmers’ interests and support agricultural development.The document also covered policies to improve the rural governance mechanism to maintain rural harmony and stability, strengthen rural primary-level Party organizations, and enhance Party leadership on agricultural and rural affairs.

The State Council issued a circular on Feb 15, urging all departments and local governments to join hands to adopt the oversight model of random inspections and public release in market supervision.Selecting targets for inspection and dispatching inspectors at random, and promptly releasing the results to the public is a major innovation in concept and method of market supervision, and an effective measure to ease the burden on enterprises and optimize the business environment, the circular said.In principle, all administrative inspections should be conducted with randomly selected market entities and inspectors, and the inspection items, plans, and results must be released to the public in a timely manner, according to the circular.Problems found through complaints and data monitoring must receive targeted inspections, and results of the inspections should be shared by all departments, the circular added.The move is aimed at enhancing the credit awareness and self-discipline of market entities, and cutting down on interruptions in their production and operation activities.The circular also said, by the end of 2020, this inspection model should be applied in all related departments.Provincial-level governments should build a unified supervision platform based on the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System and the National Credit Information Sharing Platform, to provide technical support for the random inspections, publicity and comprehensive application of the results, the circular said.Inspection item lists should be created to clarify the inspection standards, targets, and methods, it added.Provincial-level governments should establish two databases for inspection targets and inspectors in accordance with inspections items at all levels within their jurisdiction, the circular urged. The circular also asked local governments at or above the county level to create overall annual plans for inspection, which should list inspection tasks and departments involved, and strengthen the publicity of the results, while carrying out special inspections on irregularities.

The State Council has issued a guiding opinion on promoting poverty alleviation through consumption.According to the State Council circular released on Jan 14, poverty alleviation through consumption means consumption of goods and services provided by people in poor areas as a way to increase their income and help lift them out of poverty.Government organs, State-owned enterprises and public institutions should take the lead in the campaign, relatively developed provinces and cities should build long-term supply and marketing relationships with their partners in underdeveloped areas, and private enterprises are encouraged to purchase goods and services from those areas, according to the circular.To expand circulation and marketing channels for agricultural products from poor areas, large cities and poverty-stricken areas will be given support to grow a batch of enterprises in circulation facilities construction, supply-chain services and production base construction.Also, poverty-stricken areas will be given support to improve network infrastructure, and to enhance rural people’s ability to use the internet, e-commerce operators in rural areas will have access to professional services in business operation and personnel training.Also, the State Council encouraged poor areas to build a batch of local warehouses and cold storage facilities for enterprises to rent and reduce their costs.Improving the supply and quality of agricultural products in poor areas was highlighted in the circular. Efforts will be made to promote cooperation between farmers, cooperatives and enterprises, and develop contract farming in poverty-stricken areas.According to the circular, poverty-stricken areas are encouraged to build regional-based brands for special agricultural products and promote them on new media platforms.The circular also urged efforts to upgrade agri-tourism in poor areas by improving road conditions and rural environment.

Updated:

The State Council recently issued a circular pressing for improvements in the administrative enforcement of law.The circular was issued in a bid to safeguard people’s legal rights, preserve the government’s credibility, and eventually usher in a law-governing environment with increased transparency, regulation, fairness, and efficacy.An implementation plan is in place for the announcement of the new policies on administrative law enforcement, with information on government work set to be disclosed to the public beforehand.Additionally administrative law enforcement staff should make their identities clear in the execution of their duties, and law enforcement verdicts should be made public within a certain time frame.Administrative law enforcement should be recorded and documented in all regions, in the form of text and audio-visual media, among others, keeping track of law enforcement proceedings, investigations, evidence collection, auditing, verdicts, and more.These recordings should be systematically filed, in order to keep minutes on the process of law enforcement.An examination and approval system of significant administrative law enforcement verdicts should come into force as well. Departments concerned should conduct examinations and approve important cases before verdicts are released. Cases that fail to pass the related examination and approval procedure will have no right to pass verdicts.Further efforts are needed to digitize administrative law enforcement, using big data, cloud computing and other technological approaches, in a bid to establish a comprehensive management and supervision e-platform, by making the most of existing information systems and data.

			Beijing’s sub-center plans for 1.3m permanent residents 





Updated:
Jan 3,2019 9:10 PM
	    Xinhua










BEIJING — Beijing’s sub-center, which will sit in the east of the capital, aims to accommodate 1.3 million permanent residents by 2035, according to a detailed plan published on Jan 3.The city sub-center will cover 155 square kilometers and be extended to the whole area of the current Tongzhou district, which totals about 906 square kilometers, according to the plan for the sub-center’s development for 2016 to 2035, approved by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.The population density will be 9,000 residents per square kilometer at most so as to maintain a comfortable living environment, the document said.The plan pledged that the sub-center will be “an urban area without urban ills,” which will build an eco-friendly transport system focusing on public transport, adopt measures to control air, water and soil pollution, and develop strict management of water resources and intelligent urban management systems.“The sub-center will not develop real estate projects on a large scale,” the document said, adding that the market will play a decisive role in resource allocation.The plan also outlined the functions of the sub-center, measures for cultural development and coordinated development with surrounding areas in neighboring Hebei province.Beijing is shifting some of its administrative functions out of the city center into Tongzhou to help address problems including traffic congestion and air pollution. The move is also part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integrated development plan.Beijing municipal government agencies have been moving their offices to Tongzhou since the end of 2017.

	    english.gov.cn










The State Council, China’s cabinet, recently approved the overall development plan (2018-2035) for Xiongan New Area, a guideline to build the region with international standards and Chinese characteristics.According to the plan, Xiongan, an area planned to undertake the noncapital functions of Beijing, should protect ecological environment, stick to green development, and highlight people’s livelihood.With a firm hold on its strategic position, Xiongan should be built as a key region of Hebei province near Beijing, while the nation is preparing for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics, the plan stated.To better take on the noncapital functions of Beijing, the plan also urged the new area to improve infrastructure and optimize the business environment with better public services. According to the plan, universities, research institutes, medical institutions, corporate headquarters, financial institutions, and public institutions will be moved to Xiongan.The plan set a strict line for ecological protection, permanent farmland, and boundary of cities and counties. Green land and clean water will account for 70 percent of the area, with overall development scale controlled within 30 percent in the future.Meanwhile, the government will strengthen restoration of Baiyangdian lakes, raise afforestation, and improve air quality in the region, and a national park around Baiyangdian wetland is also planned.Integrated urban and rural development and new urbanization are stressed. Population and industries will be properly guided and distributed, with work done to build distinctive towns and beautiful villages.In terms of landscape, the plan stressed that urban design should demonstrate Chinese style, lake scenery, and innovative trends, and high-rise buildings will not be on the list.To make Xiongan an ideal area for living and working, high-quality public service resources will be introduced, and a shared, multi-layered, and comprehensive basic public service network will be built.The plan also emphasizes a housing system with balanced weight on renting and purchasing and prohibits large-scale commercial real estate.At the same time, the rail and road networks among Xiongan, Beijing, Tianjin, nearby cities, and Beijing Daxing International Airport will be connected at a faster pace. A diversified, convenient, green, and smart public traffic system will also be built in the area.The area, as required in the plan, will promote low-carbon living, production, and city operation, build intensive and efficient water supply system, and optimize energy structure with well-arranged underground facilities.To become a global leading innovative city, high-end industries, talent and innovative enterprises will be introduced, and the area will take a step ahead in smart infrastructure, including integrated, safe, and ubiquitous broadband communication network and multi-source sensing system.Urban security, disaster prevention, and stable supply of clean energy are also highlighted in the plan.

The State Council released a document on Nov 8 focusing on improving the business environment, urging policies to be accurately carried out regarding easing enterprises’ burdens.Fairness is highlighted on the list of priorities. A revised negative list must be finished and put into practice by the end of 2018, which will lower the market threshold for social capital in civil aviation, railroad and other areas, and give the green light to more projects that represent public-private partnerships.A slew of favorable policies to help relieve financing difficulties for medium-sized, small and micro enterprises should be issued and implemented in a timely manner, local protection and administrative monopolies should be eradicated, and government credit must be enhanced, as requested in the document.Opening-up is set to be increased to a higher level. It is asked that access limitation outside the negative list for foreign investment be canceled before next March. Large-scale foreign investments eligible for major project development plans will receive support such as land and sea-use approval procedures. Quickened custom clearance procedures and export rebates are also urged.Moreover, cutting red tape in administrative approval must be stepped up, and a unified government service mode should be spread nationwide.Fees will be reduced in a more extensive way, especially in logistics, certification, inspection and testing and public use sectors. Illegal charges from industry associations, intermediate agencies and institutions under government departments should be stopped, so as to eliminate unreasonable margins for enterprises. The burden of the social insurance rate also needs to be cut down for enterprises.Meanwhile, protection to intellectual property rights will also be scaled up. The censoring period for trademark registration should be compressed to six months, and regulations over law enforcement in online shopping, export and import should be formulated before the year’s end.Divisions of responsibility for supervision and organization are made explicit to ensure the policies are thoroughly enacted.

			Blueprint promulgated for Hainan pilot free trade zone 





Updated:
Oct 16,2018 7:51 PM
	    english.gov.cn










A general plan for the Hainan pilot free trade zone was rolled out on Oct 16, with the ambition to build the province into a high-standard free trade hub by 2020 in terms of openness, investment convenience, legal environment and financial services.The free trade zone will cover the whole island, featuring tourism, modern service industry, and high-technology industry. But the development of land and sea areas should abide by Chinese laws and requirements of ecological civilization, as stated in the plan.Efforts will be strengthened in creating a new system of open economy. The threshold will be largely lowered for foreign capital, which will be granted with pre-establishment national treatment and managed according to the negative list. For example, foreign capital is allowed for setting up performance troupes as long as the Chinese side holds the biggest share, and restrictions are eliminated for foreign investment in manufacturing new energy cars.International trade will be facilitated with a string of measures, such as the “one-stop” service window that has integrated data from various departments for customs clearance.Moreover, a new supervision system will be implemented on trading goods. And new trading business models, such as cross-border e-commerce, are encouraged to push forward trade transformation and upgrade. Openness innovation also will be stepped up in the financial sector to back up Hainan’s real economy, as well as trade and investment. Countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative are welcome to help build the free trade zone.The service industry will get a boost. Favorable policies will be given to the modern service industry, including international healthcare, civil aviation cooperation, international exhibitions and competitions. The capacity of international shipping will be increased by establishing an influential shipping center and encouraging shipping enterprises to set up headquarters or operation centers.Support also will be extended to high-end tourism. Cruise shipping lanes around and starting from Hainan island will be enriched. Foreign tourist groups can enjoy visa-free visits for 15 days if entering the island on a cruise ship. And procedures for foreign yachts entering will be simplified.Hainan intends to enhance international technological cooperation, especially in breeding and biosafety projects.Meanwhile, local government is asked to accelerate function transformation in a more supportive way for building the pilot free trade zone. Institutional and administrative reform will go deep, giving Hainan provincial government more authority in allocating administrative resources.With the aim of forging a first-class business environment, fair competition censorship will be implemented to guarantee various market bodies have equal rights to enter in relative sectors or businesses. Administrative approval and other service procedures will be standardized and streamlined, with internet platforms widely utilized. Efforts also will be made in improving the intellectual property rights protection system and providing convenience for foreign talents who work in the pilot free trade zone.For fundamental support, a comprehensive risk prevention system will be established, and the whole construction of the pilot free trade zone should be under the Party’s leadership, as stressed in the plan.

			Three-year plan on transportation restructuring launched





Updated:
Oct 9,2018 5:09 PM
	    english.gov.cn










The State Council recently issued a three-year plan to push forward restructuring transportation, in a bid to efficiently tackle pollution, raise the efficiency of transportation and lower logistics costs.The plan is part of supply-side structural reform and will improve the overall transportation network by transferring some of the road volume to railroads and waterways.According to the plan, compared with 2017, the country will witness a 30 percent increase in railway transportation volume, or 1.1 trillion tons, and the waterway transportation volume will be 7.5 percent and 500 trillion tons, by 2020. Accordingly, the road transportation volume for bulk cargo will see a reduction of 440 billion tons, whereas the multi-modal transportation volume will see a 20 percent annual increase.The plan concentrates on North China’s Beijing municipality, Tianjin, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Hebei province, and Shanxi province, East China’s Shanghai, Shandong province, Henan province, Jiangsu province, Zhejiang province, and Anhui province, Northeast China’s Liaoning province, and Northwest China’s Shaanxi province.With regard to the work in boosting railway transportation capacity, the plan said that further improvements should be made in arterial railway transportation, with related policies, such as the long-term plan on construction of railway network, being efficiently implemented.Meanwhile, construction of railway lines for exclusive use by large industrial and mining enterprises and logistic zones will be sped up, 80 percent of which, with annual transportation volume of over 1.5 million tons, will be exclusive lines by 2020.Organization of the railway transportation system will be further optimized, prioritizing the supply of coal, hard cokes, ores, and cereals, compounded with flexible and better coordinated train arrangements.Service of railway transportation will be further boosted as well, with more efforts to be made in structural reform of the market-led transportation pricing system. And the plan also encourages direct cooperation between railway transportation enterprises and ports, logistics zones, large industrial and mining enterprises, and logistic enterprises.As for upgrading the waterway transportation system, an improved inland and coastal waterway transportation system is in order, on the premise of well-protected ecology and environment.Additionally, the connection among port distribution railways with backbone railways and container yards should be constantly pushed forward. By 2020, key ports, both coastal and inland, will be covered with a distribution railway network. The direct transportation from rivers to seas, according to the plan, will also be substantially boosted, with more effort in restructuring port facilities and research on ships. In order to alleviate excessive road transportation volume, the plan emphasizes the regulation in freight overload. Weighing tests for freight vehicles will be completely applicable at toll stations all across the board by 2020, with overload rates lower than 0.5 percent.In addition, standardization of freight vehicle models will be beefed up, with related enterprises and industries rendering subpar vehicles obsolete while ushering in standardized ones.As the plan said, the intensive development of road transportation will be propelled, in a bid to facilitate the emerging business types and modes of Internet Plus freight and logistics.The circular encouraged enterprises in railways, ports and shipping to strengthen cooperation and promote shipping containers to transport through railway ports.It supports the construction of multimodal demonstration projects, and urges operational monitoring of the project, as well as the innovation of transportation organization models.In addition, more support is pledged to the green freight distribution demonstration projects in urban areas, aimed at completing around 100 projects by 2020. The country will speed up promotion of new energy and clean energy distribution vehicles. By 2020, among new and updated vehicles in urban areas, over half will be new energy vehicles or clean energy vehicles, with 80 percent for key areas, according to the State Council.Work is also planned to combine roads and railways to transport production and living provisions for cities, and build a new distribution mode of “rails + warehouses” in urban logistics.Public information platforms on multimodal transportation should be established as soon as possible, for information exchanges and sharing between different departments, such as transportation, customs and market supervision, according to the circular.Information reporting and monitoring analysis on transportation structure adjustment will also be strengthened.In addition, the State Council promised financial support policies. The use of land for special railway lines, and the use of sea for wharves for combined railway-water transportation and cargo shipment are being guaranteed.A good environment for development was also promised.

Updated:

	    english.gov.cn










The State Council recently issued a circular, pressing for implementation of the separation between business licenses and permits nationwide. The State Council fully affirmed the pilot project in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, and urged the spread of its success on a larger scale. According to the circular, the separation between business licenses and permits will be applied nationwide, in a bid to substantially reduce institutional transaction costs for enterprises, bring the market’s vitality into full play, speed up the work on administration streamlining, and create a law-based, international and convenient business environment.The business license is a legislative document issued to market entities by related registration authorities on the premise of meeting certain requirements and fulfilling verification of business capacity, in accordance with related regulations and legal proceedings.With the combining of multiple business credentials, market entities are able to conduct regular business operations by virtue of the business license alone.And the operation permit is a credential issued to specific market entities whose business operations call for attainment of both the business permit and license.According to the circular, separation between the business permit and license will be carried out on the first lot of 106 administrative approval items for enterprises. The work will be laid out by means of direct exemption from approvals, replacement by filling management, permits in the form of notification and commitment, and optimization in services for accessing the market.Additionally, the circular stressed that approval procedures will remain for items that are associated with national security, public security, financial security, biological security, and public health, with improvements to be made in services for accessing the market.Supervision during and after approvals will be further stepped up, with information sharing, synergistic supervision, and coordinated reward and punishment established among departments.Meanwhile, a long-term mechanism will be launched to propel synchronized reform in administrative approvals at both the national and regional levels.Corresponding expansion will come after successful pilot projects, in a bid to facilitate the all-around and well-organized implementation of separation between business licenses and permits nationwide, the circular said.

			More production permits for industrial goods to be canceled





Updated:
Sep 30,2018 5:15 PM
	    english.gov.cn










The State Council has decided to cut more production permits for industrial goods, and delegate some of them to provincial quality inspection departments, according to a circular released on Sept 30.Fourteen kinds of production permits, including for refrigeration equipment, gas appliance and lifesaving appliances, were eliminated, and approvals for four kinds of permits, including for combustion engines and anti-counterfeiting technical products, were delegated to lower levels.After the move, products that require production permits were reduced from 38 to 24, and only seven of them need approval from national quality inspection departments.The approval process for production permits is being simplified. Product examinations organized by issuing authorities will be canceled. Instead, applicant enterprises only need to submit qualified test reports. On-site examinations for products requiring provincial-level permits can be arranged after the license has been awarded, except for dangerous chemicals. A license can be presented as long as enterprises submit related documents and make a quality-security commitment. And one license will be issued to one company, regardless of its number of product types.The document showed that goods relating to public security, public health and environmental protection, will be replaced by mandatory certification. A list of these products will be compiled and released to the public, and certification charges will be funded by public finance.While implementing compulsory certification, support measures should be used to encourage enterprises that are willing to be certified, so that brand development and market expansion can be promoted, according to the circular.For items that still require approvals, related departments are urged to improve quality standards, strengthen supervision and evaluate risks in a timely manner.

The State Council issued a circular on Sept 5, pressing provincial-level authorities, ministries and administrations affiliated to the State Council for further efforts in pushing forward the natural gas production industry.According to the circular, natural gas, a premium low-carbon energy source, should be better developed and utilized. Natural gas production is a mainstay of constructing a modern energy system as well as advancing the restructuring of energy production and consumption.But there is an array of pressing matters that the industry faces, such as domestic output falling short of consumption, lack of diversity in importation, unbalanced consumption structure, and infrastructure facilities lagging behind.As stated in the circular, the sustainable development of natural gas production and marketing will be strengthened under a set of principles, with emphasis on overall planning of the supply, reserves and sale of natural gas, adherence to the market-oriented mode, and orderly implementation of related policies.In order to beef up the construction of an all-around system covering production, supply, reserves, and sale of natural gas, as well as promote a dynamic and balanced mechanism of supply and demand, the circular also presented a range of measures.Further efforts should be made to usher in a wide spectrum of improvements, such as propelling domestic exploration and development of natural gas, building up an overseas supply system featuring diversity, constructing a multifaceted reserves system, and cementing the construction of infrastructure for natural gas production, the circular said.In addition, specific mechanisms featuring balance and stability are highlighted in the circular, to forecast and forewarn of supply and demand, regulate demand, and to provide contingent support in case of short supply.

			New measures to spur residential consumption


		Hu Yongqi


Updated:
Sep 21,2018 6:57 AM
	    China Daily










China aims to tap the potential of residential consumption by optimizing its structure, increasing the use of services and other measures, according to a new guideline released on Sept 20.The guideline was released jointly by the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.The document aims for a smoother cycle in which the upgrading of consumption leads to supply innovation. That, in turn, would improve new growth of consumption to achieve a higher level of balanced supply and demand.Meanwhile, an environment with safer products and services should be created. Also, trust should be increased between consumers and producers under strengthened market regulations, the guideline said. Key standards for products and services should be fully established to improve their quality and better satisfy consumers, the document said.Consumption is the ultimate end and motivation for production, and improvement of consumption is beneficial for optimizing the ratio between production and consumption, building an economic development model in line with China’s long-term interests and promoting healthy economic development, the document said.It also is beneficial to promote production and supply-side structural reform, move economic transformation forward and achieve high-quality development, it said.However, producers are finding it difficult to meet the diverse demand of urban and rural residents. Regulatory mechanisms struggle to manage new, fast-growing businesses and models, the guideline said. The system to ensure quality and standards lags behind the need for increasing consumption, it said.The guideline aims to increase supplies of high-quality products and services, better protect the legal rights of consumers and give them independence in choices. A more inviting market environment will be cultivated for all enterprises to provide products and services in a fair way.Inclusive and cautious regulation should be conducted to boost new consumption. The document urges adherence to green development standards and development of healthy and rational consumption.

	    english.gov.cn










The State Council released a circular on Sept 18 to further clarify and regulate the legal system for environmental protection by removing regulations or administrative documents not in line with the central government’s guidelines and related laws. The move is targeted at regulations or documents on ecology and environmental protection released by above-county level local departments or by departments under the State Council.According to the circular, the streamlining task should be conducted by corresponding government departments that formulated the regulations or documents. If the departments responsible for the regulations or documents are removed or adjusted, the work should be handed over to their successors. In the meantime, related departments under the State Council should clarify the reasons for any removal or revision of regulations, and put forward specific suggestions or proposals on later updates.The final results on such tasks should be reported to the State Council before Oct 15, and a copy be sent to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the Ministry of Justice. The two ministries are required to follow the work process to ensure smooth progress is achieved.

Updated:

	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has issued a circular, stressing the orderly development of urban rail transit systems to meet the actual demands of cities.
Urban rail transit is important to the transportation systems of modern cities, but in some cities, problems in excessive construction and misconduct in the use of funds still exist, leading to heavier debt burdens for local governments, according to the circular.
The circular stressed efforts to control the debt risks of local governments and develop urban rail transit in a reasonable manner to fit the level of a city’s development.
Urban rail transit, except for trams, should be listed in a city’s transportation system planning and subject to review and approval procedures, said the circular.
Cities that can apply for constructing subways should have more than 30 billion yuan in public budget revenues, a regional GDP of more than 300 billion yuan, and a permanent urban population of 3 million.
Also, cities that can apply for constructing light rail should have more than 15 billion yuan in public budget revenues, a regional GDP of more than 150 billion yuan, and a permanent urban population of 1.5 million, the circular said.
The circular required the reasonable planning of urban rail transit networks to ensure that the local government’s expenditures in construction and operation are within financial resources. It also encouraged use of land conservation technologies and models and carrying out environmental impact assessment.
Local governments should set up transparent capital funds, and a long-term mechanism on capital input should be set up to ensure sufficient funds during construction. 
The circular stressed supporting local reform in investment and financing systems, attracting private investment in the sector, and carrying out diversified operations.
It also called on efforts to control local government debt resulting from urban rail transit construction, and asked local governments to control the liability ratio of construction enterprises.
An interministerial supervision mechanism should be established, and regular inspection systems should be set up by local governments, the circular said.

It underlined the importance of a free and convenient business environment, called for building up an international-level “single window” to simplify the customs process and lower institutional costs while importing products.

			Pension funds for enterprise employees to be centrally coordinated





Updated:
Jun 13,2018 2:09 PM
	    english.gov.cn










China is expected to set up a central adjustment system for enterprise employees’ pension funds starting July 1, according to a circular issued by the State Council.Owing to the unbalanced regional economy and the old-age dependency ratio, the scale of pension fund pools and payment pressures for basic pensions vary in different provinces and regions. The adjustment mechanism at the central level is expected to enable sustainability of the basic pension system nationwide.At present, the pension fund for enterprise employees is managed at the provincial level. After establishing the central adjustment system, the fund can be balanced among different provinces to guarantee timely and sufficient allocation.The central adjustment fund is constituted through drawing a certain proportion (at least 3 percent) of capital from provincial basic pension funds. The cardinal number of capital turned in is calculated by multiplying 90 percent of each province’s average salary of enterprise employees by the number of should-be contributors.The central fund raised will be distributed to provinces within the same year according to the province’s number of retirees, as confirmed by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the Ministry of Finance.Collection and payment of the central pension fund are managed independently, and should not be used in other ways, such as balancing the budget.However, the current pension subsidy policy from the central government will remain the same. If a province still has a deficiency after being granted financial subsidies and central adjustment, local governments should take responsibility to cover the deficit.A mechanism will be established to divide shortage responsibility among local governments at different levels.The implementation of the pension fund central adjustment system will be included into the assessment of provincial governments’ work.Information construction is also demanded, such as building a searching platform to check individual pension payments and their remuneration, a monitor system for central pension fund adjustments and a central database shared nationwide.The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the Ministry of Finance are in charge of formulating a timetable and road map for implementation of the pension fund central adjustment system, as well as guidance and supervision.

According to a circular recently released by the State Council, China will further reduce the length of time required to open a business, in a further bid to usher in a legal, international and convenient business environment and facilitate sustainable and high-quality economic development. As the circular said, more efforts will be made to step up reforms streamlining administration and delegating power to lower levels; addressing issues plaguing enterprises and the public; and highlighting inefficiency, red tape and difficulties in opening a business.The length of time required will be substantially shortened, with a considerable increase in efficiency, transparency and predictability in related governmental services. Additionally, there will be further reductions in government-imposed transaction costs, unleashing incentives for mass innovation and entrepreneurship.The procedures that a new firm needs to go through to become initially operational will be further streamlined, the circular added, and the length of time required to start a business in municipalities, sub-provincial cities and provincial capitals will be lessened from 20 workdays on average to 8.5 by the end of the year. Other regional authorities should also adopt vigorous measures to compress the required time, with all regions reaching the goal across the board in the first half of 2019.All authorities concerned should transform the previous time-consuming procedures into a one-stop checklist, featuring one single form for application materials, simultaneous management, information sharing, prompt completion and one single window for multiagency services.Government approval of business names before registration will no longer be needed unless specifically required. It grants enterprises more autonomy in choosing their own names, and more convenience as this procedure can be concluded during business registration, which shall be reduced to five days or less. The approving procedure for official seals will be replaced by the record-filing procedure for official seals, which will be incorporated into the reform to integrate different certification requirements for business registration. The market regulatory authorities will take charge of the collection of related information and upload it onto the sharing platforms. And applicants may also choose their own providers for official seals, said the circular.Neither will a separate tax registration be required, nor a separate social insurance registration certificate be issued for enterprises that have already claimed business licenses with unified credit codes. The amount of time required for invoice application and social insurance registration will also be decreased, with a two-day invoice application procedure for newly established enterprises. The State Administration for Market Regulation, the major driver for halving the time for opening a business, should coordinate together with the concerned departments, said the circular.The National Development and Reform Commission and the National Bureau of Statistics will be in charge of constructing a unified national assessment system for the business environment, which is aimed at enhancing enterprises and the public’s sense of participation and convenience by formulating feasible assessment benchmark and measures.Additionally, the assessment will be piloted in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, evaluating the business situations of enterprises, which will eventually develop into a normal assessment mechanism with further improvements, said the circular.

The State Council has released a circular regarding clearing up existing regulations and documents associated with property rights protection. This is aimed at protecting economic property rights and other legal rights of various ownerships based on laws and equality, with a favorable legal environment in place, in a bid to boost market entities’ vitality in innovation and entrepreneurship and push forward continuous healthy economic development.According to the circular, the work covers regulations formulated by governments at several levels, including provincial, autonomous regional, municipal, cities divided into districts and autonomous prefectures, as well as departments under the State Council.The work, the circular said, focuses on stipulations violating the equal protection of all ownership economy entities’ property rights, rights of use, managerial rights, rights to yields and more; stipulations improperly restricting enterprises from exercising rights of production and management and hindering enterprises and citizens from real estate transactions, as well as stipulations discriminately treating economic entities of different ownerships in terms of market access and the utilization of production factors, among others.The work will be carried out under the principles of accountability. Regulations and normative documents issued by authorities above county level will be taken care of by the original policymakers, the circular said.All departments of the State Council, when conducting the clearing up work, should present specific suggestions, amendment plans, and justifications for amendment and abolishment, and launch public inquiries, if anything in the laws and regulations found to be against property rights protection.Local governments and departments of all levels are required to understand the significance of the clearing up work, lay out specific plans, clarify the division of labor and duration, and efficiently carry out tasks. Additionally, the implementation of the work entails strengthened supervision and examination, the establishment of a long-acting mechanism for screening regulations on property rights protection, and dynamic clearing up work to improve property rights protection.In addition, the circular said any departments that are found to be lax in the clearing up tasks will be held accountable in accordance with laws and regulations.

Updated:

	    Xinhua










BEIJING — Chinese authorities published a guideline on May 23 to cut red tape and improve government efficiency so that the public and businesses can have easier access to public service.A set of measures will streamline those public services that directly affect the daily lives of ordinary people and normal business practices, according to the guideline issued by the General Offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.The work is aimed at minimizing the visits ordinary citizens and business people have to make to government departments, the document said.New practices, such as 24-hour online government, one-stop applications and minimal procedure, have already made a difference, said a news release from the State Commission Office of Public Sectors Reform.Those practices have significantly lowered institutional transaction costs and improved the administrative and business environments. However, the current improvement still has not reached the level of comprehensively deepening reform, nor met the expectations of the public.According to the new guideline, public services should be online. If law and conditions allow, up to 80 percent of administrative approvals and other services could be processed on line. Public services should be available in neighborhoods and communities so citizens do not have to travel far. Procedures should be simplified so that most matters can be handled in one visit.A national information platform will be established to integrate the databases of departments and regions.National and provincial governments will share their databases with public services at lower levels, including databases for identity checks, taxation, real estate registration and social security.Databases and office systems within provincial divisions will be integrated into one network and share information.

			Work division laid out for implementing Government Work Report






Updated:
Apr 12,2018 7:45 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The work division among China’s ministerial departments has been projected for carrying out the Government Work Report this year, according to a State Council circular on April 12.
A total of 57 specific tasks in 12 aspects are distributed to main ministries and departments in line with their functions, including the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.
The document set the general target for economic growth in 2018, with GDP increasing 6.5 percent, consumer price index (CPI) rising 3 percent, newly added employment in urban areas reaching more than 11 million, surveyed urban unemployment rate within 5.5 percent and urban registered unemployment rate within 4.5 percent.
Fiscal policies should stay positive, said the circular. A deficit rate of 2.6 percent is set aside, lowered 0.4 percentage points from last year’s budget. Fiscal deficit should be 2.38 trillion yuan with the central government’s fiscal deficit at 1.55 trillion yuan and local fiscal deficit 8.3 trillion yuan. In addition, the monetary policy should remain prudent and neutral.
To push forward supply-side structural reform, new driving forces such as big data and artificial intelligence should get a boost, as well as high-end industries including 5G and new energy cars, to forge a manufacturing power, said the document. 
Overcapacity should be further cut, by weeding out 30 million tons of steel and 150 million tons of coal.
Nationwide administrative reform should be widely promoted, and more taxes should be reduced to relieve burdens on enterprises.
In order to build innovative power, a national innovation system should be established to spur scientists and technicians’ creativity, and to promote mass entrepreneurship and mass innovation as well.
Reforms in key areas still need to be increased, said the circular, especially for State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private enterprises, fiscal and tax system, financial system, and ecological civilization.
The Government Work Report also proposed three key fights to win in 2018: To guard against major risks, reduce poverty, and make greater progress in pollution control. It set the target of over 10 million people in rural areas to be moved out of poverty, and sulfur dioxide and nitric oxide emission to be cut by 3 percent.
Concerning fully implementing the rural area revitalization strategy, the document called for improving the urban-rural integrated development mechanism and promoting supply-side structural reform in agriculture. High-quality farmland should be increased to over 80 million mu, and high-efficiency water-saving irrigation should cover over 20 million mu.
The quality of new-type urbanization should be increased. In 2018, 13 million more people should be settled in cities with urban hukou, according to the circular.
The growth of foreign investment should be promoted steadily, and the open range and level will be further expanded. The general manufacturing industry should be fully unlocked; openness of fields such as telecommunications, medical care, education, elderly care, and new energy vehicles should be expanded. Experiences in free-trade pilot zones should be replicated and promoted, said the document.
Efforts should also be made to improve people’s lives and promote entrepreneurship and innovation, with a focus on the employment of university graduates, disabled people, and migrant workers.
People’s income should be steadily promoted, the document stressed. Basic pension of retired people, and urban and rural residents should be continuously increased. The minimum payment standard should be adjusted appropriately, and the tax threshold for individual income should be higher.
A new three-year plan for shantytown renovation should begin, with the goal of 5.8 million units in 2018. Public rental housing should cover a wider range of people.
The circular also urged improving government efficiency in an all-around way, including optimizing government institutions and functions, and increasing the government’s credibility and executive capacity.
Ministries and departments should make specific plans to promote the assigned duties, and report to the State Council before April 20, the document said.

China will further publicize its governmental work in 2018 in four main aspects: responding to public concerns, improving government services, building platforms for information disclosure, and standardizing information openness, said a circular issued by the State Council on April 24.The move is aimed at pushing forward restructuring governmental bodies, advancing administration streamlining and power delegating, facilitating the sustainability of economic and social development, and laying the groundwork for the construction of a service-oriented government.According to the document, an all-around governmental work disclosure will be bound by legislative work, which means that all items and policies, unless legally subject to confidentiality, should be open to the public, in order to facilitate law-based administration and protect people’s right-to-know.Major sectors will be granted more autonomy in information disclosure, including fiscal budget and final accounts, approval and implementation of significant projects, distribution of public resources, and more.Policies on market expectancy will be mapped out in further detail, highlighting interpretations for policies regarding precautions against major risks, targeted poverty alleviation, and pollution prevention. Efforts should also be made to further active reaction to public opinion in terms of their major concerns, and efficiently forecast, analyze, and deal with those associated with important policies on the economy and society, authority of the Communist Party of China and the government, and public morality. The document also called for further improving online governmental services, with an increasing number of service items available on the internet, bringing more convenience to the public.Governmental services in physical offices will be continuously strengthened, which comes with a unified set of standards and integrated work flow, greatly enhancing the efficiency and quality of governmental services.Furthermore, approval services will be further optimized in accordance with the policy of streamlining administration and delegating powers, including timely disclosure of when enterprises are open for business, simplified procedures for approving construction projects, among others. Regulations in constructing e-government portals will be stepped up, the circular stressed, in order to substantially amplify information resources, and upgrade the information retrieval system and other related services.Weibo, WeChat, and mobile service applications will be intensely utilized to further information disclosure, and governmental hotlines will be systematically integrated to benefit the public.Additionally, positive disclosure of basic directory on government affairs will be implemented at all levels, according to the circular.

			China approves master plan for Xiongan New Area






Updated:
Apr 20,2018 6:34 PM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China’s central authorities have approved a master plan for Xiongan New Area, reiterating that its creation will carry “lasting importance for the millennium to come.”
The plan was approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council, according to a document released on April 20.
“The establishment of Xiongan New Area in Hebei province is a significant decision and arrangement by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core to push forward the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei,” the plan reads.
Xiongan is another new area of “national significance” following the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and Shanghai Pudong New Area, according to the document.
The area’s creation is “a strategy that will have lasting importance for the millennium to come, and a significant national event.”
In April 2017, China announced the establishment of Xiongan New Area, spanning three counties in Hebei province about 100 km southwest of downtown Beijing.
(Xiongan) should have “a scientific, spatial urban layout,” the document says.
An area of about 100 square km between Rongcheng and Anxin counties will be developed first. The area for medium-term development, covering about 200 square km, will grow in a “steady and orderly manner,” and a larger area will be demarcated for future growth.
Xiongan will be a location for many of Beijing’s non-capital functions and relocated population. The area will become a new home for Beijing’s colleges, hospitals, business headquarters, financial and public institutions that meet the requirement of Xiongan’s status and development.
Xiongan will be under intelligent management. It should be built into a world-leading digital city fully synchronized with the brick-and-mortar one. Intelligent infrastructure will be incorporated in the basic fiber of the city.
With maintaining a green environment one of the priorities, the area’s forest coverage will be increased to 40 percent, according to the document.
It says the new area should promote innovation-driven development and create a modern industrial system that facilitates coordinated development of the real economy, technological innovation, finance and human resources.
As a livable and business-friendly city, large-scale real estate development will be prohibited. There will be no skyscrapers “as a matter of principle.”
Xiongan will be turned into a highland for reform and opening-up, and it should explore new ways to promote high-quality development and develop a modernized economy in the new era.
The new area should ensure urban safety, with focuses placed on prevention of disasters, public security and emergency response. Standards for flood control and earthquake-proof should be made in a scientific way, according to the document.
Development should be integrated with nearby cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang and Baoding.

The circular urged advancing the “tourism plus” program, promoting industrial integration and exploring new functions in region-based tourism.
The region-based tourism modes should feature diversity and environmental protection, the circular added.
The aim is to develop an integrated, quality, regulated tourism ecosystem that can generate maximum benefit.
The circular stressed efforts to extend tourism in other fields and industries, including integration with urban planning to build tourist towns and counties, with agriculture and forestry for sightseeing agriculture and forest parks and with technology for development of high-end healthcare tourism.
The circular also urged exploring cultural traits and folklore in tourism areas, upgrading quality of traditional craft art products, and bringing in new technologies for tourism products.
Entrepreneurship and innovation programs were also encouraged, and diverse investment entities will be welcomed.
According to the circular, tourism areas were encouraged to enhance service quality, build high-quality tourism brands and introduce intelligent services such as free Wi-Fi and online booking and payment.
In addition, public facilities should be enhanced. The circular called for efforts to push ahead the “toilet revolution” and improve transportation network, consultation service centers in traffic hubs and guideposts.
The circular also urged protecting resources and the environment, and carrying out poverty-alleviation work by utilizing potential in tourism resources.
The government should increase policy support in finance, land use and talent, the circular read.

			Guidelines show continued progress

The State Council’s plan for setting up regulations and submitting them for legislation this year has reflected China’s progress in reform and opening up as well as its progress on policy transparency and consistency, experts said.
On March 14, the general office of the State Council, China’s Cabinet, unveiled the State Council’s list of setting up guidelines and regulations in different areas in 2018, as well as the list of drafts that will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress for legislation.
Compared to the draft plan a year ago, a total of 58 new items were added into this year’s plan, covering a variety of areas including economic development, political system, measures to improve people’s livelihoods, culture, environmental protection, government information publicity, as well as foreign policy.
Among them, sixteen will be submitted to the NPC Standing Committee for approval for legislation, including the drafting of the tax law on vehicle purchasing, foreign investment law, tax law on (nature) resources, and archives law, as well as some others.
Wang Baoming, professor on legislation at the Chinese Academy of Governance, said the new plan shows China’s resolution on opening up and maintaining policy consistency.
“Last year, the State Council issued two guidelines encouraging foreign investment, which was not common in the past. While this shows the government’s resolution in furthering opening up, putting these guidelines forward will help China to embrace foreign investors in a fairer, more transparent and better-regulated manner,” Wang said, adding the context this year marks the 40th anniversary of China’ reform and opening-up policy.
China’s resolute steps in further opening up and attracting more foreign investment were also reiterated by Premier Li Keqiang during his news conference on March 20.
“The negative list for inbound investment will be shortened in the course of this year and the coming years. We aim to merge the three laws governing foreign investment into one law, and fully honor our commitment to foreign investors…,” Li told reporters.
“Our goal is to gradually create a level playing field in a market of 1.3 billion consumers for both Chinese and foreign-invested enterprises of all types of ownership. This will provide Chinese consumers with more options and incentivize the upgrading of Chinese products and services and that of the overall economy.”
While applauding the legislation move, Wang pointed out that legislation should move at a proper pace and avoid being dragged out for too long before legislation was enacted.
“In the past, there has been a phenomenon that saw one piece of legislation draft seek opinions from the public and among ministries for a year or two, and this has slowed the pace of legislation. Such delays have also led to problems in economic development,” he said.
At the same time, a number of tax laws will also be submitted to the NPC for approval, according to the State Council notice. Among them are tax laws on vehicle purchasing, resource tax and tax on cultivated farmland. Information from the State Administration of Taxation shows that both drafts of the vehicle purchasing law and resource tax have been published to gauge feedback from the public and different ministries.
Liu Jianwen, a professor at Peking University Law School and a specialist on tax regulation, said that putting the vehicle-purchasing regulation into legislation is an important step in implementing the principle of law-based taxation.
Wang said that customers pay up in the form of fees rather than taxes, while the amount of fees may vary across different provinces and regions.
Pointing out that there are only three years left before realizing the goal of implementing the law-based taxation principle, Liu said there are currently 18 types of taxes yet only six tax laws for regulation, adding that steps in drafting tax laws need to be accelerated.
According to the statement, the State Council also plans to draft some 27 regulations in areas of government investigation and social organization registration. Another 15 regulations, such as government information publicity, will be revised by the State Council for further improvement this year.

			China to initiate big science projects





Updated:
Mar 28,2018 6:57 PM
	    english.gov.cn










China will play an active role in significant international scientific research projects, as planned by the State Council.Since China is keen to enhance its innovation competence and have influence in the international arena, it regards organizing big science projects as a powerful tool to solve key global scientific issues and aggregate cutting-edge scientific resources, as well as to construct a global innovation governance system. In that, scientific diplomacy will help to enhance cooperation with other countries.The short-term goal for the big science project plan is to cultivate three to five projects by 2020, and select and initiate one to two big science projects, then form a nascent mechanism of organizing big science projects.By mid-century, a slew of such projects will be incubated, and China will play a big role in global scientific innovation governance system while continuing to make contributions to solving major global scientific issues.To accomplish this, first of all, a strategic plan will be made to prioritize several subjects, such as evolution of the universe, climate change, health, energy, agriculture and information technology.Also, the process involving project selecting, cultivation, proposing and implementation should be optimized. There also should be a management mechanism in compliance with the characteristics of scientific programs, with special scientific institutions taking charge of the projects’ development.China also will actively participate in other countries’ big science projects and make complementary contributions. Organization tasks will fall in relative ministries and commissions, including the Ministry of Science and Technology, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and Chinese Academy of Sciences.The science projects will welcome investment from local governments, enterprises and international organizations. To build a talent pool, China also will give incentives to high-level professionals nationwide, and build a global recruitment system to attract top-level scientists and technical talent.A supervision and assessment mechanism also will be established, according to the plan.

	    english.gov.cn










The State Council issued a circular on March 26 concerning the inter-provincial management of newly added arable land and spare construction land.Management methods of newly added arable landAccording to China’s arable land use policy, when a piece of arable land is used for non-agricultural purposes, another piece of arable land of the same quantity and quality should be provided to strike a balance.For some municipalities and provinces with a serious shortage of arable land resources, when there is no additional arable land to make up the arable land loss as a result of necessary occupation, such as major projects construction, the lost land can be compensated in other provinces rich in arable land reserves.Major projects here refer to projects in the fields of transportation, energy, water conservancy, the military and national defense.The inter-provincial land compensation plan should be approved by the State Council.The circular requires that inter-county arable land coordination should be taken as a primary solution, and intra-provincial management as a backup plan.Provincial and municipal governments should apply for the national adjustment of newly added arable land, and the Ministry of Land and Resources is responsible for the follow-up assessment.Construction units should pay for land reclamation when applying for construction, and provincial and municipal governments should pay for newly added arable land offered by other provinces.The Ministry of Land and Resources will work with other departments to identify the proper provinces, and give priority to the old revolutionary bases, ethnic areas, frontier areas, poverty-stricken areas, and areas with outstanding performance in arable land protection.The compensation standard is 50,000 yuan for each 0.067 hectare of newly added arable land and 100,000 yuan for each 0.067 hectare of paddy field. The compensation for standard grain production capacity of newly added arable land should follow the criteria of 10,000 yuan for 100 kilograms per 0.067 hectare.The methods shall take effect from the date of issuance to Dec 31, 2022.Management methods of spare construction landThe central government will be responsible for the inter-provincial management of spare quotas for construction land in poverty-stricken regions, the circular said.According to China’s policy for the use of urban and rural construction land, the decrease in rural construction land should be linked with the increase of newly added urban construction land.The poverty-stricken areas should avoid blind land reclamation and guarantee farmers’ lawful rights and interests while preserving local historical and cultural features, according to the circular.The Ministry of Land and Resources is in charge of spare quota management.Provinces that use the quotas should strictly control the expansion of construction land, and the quotas are not allowed to be used in the downtown areas of metropolises, the circular stated.Extremely poverty-stricken areas should carry out land reclamation and resident relocation without destroying the ecological environment.The methods shall take effect from the date of issuance to Dec 31, 2020.

Payments for technicians will be raised to enhance status
Payments for technicians, especially those with specialized skills, will be raised through greater incentives, said a guideline released on March 22 by the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.
More public services are targeting highly-skilled technicians with higher incomes as the group in general is encouraged to contribute more to China’s innovation and entrepreneurship.
Incentives will be released to ensure steady salary increases for highly-skilled technicians while State-owned enterprises should focus more on leading technicians when it comes to salary allocations. The increase in salaries for highly-skilled technicians should not be lower than that for the management of SOEs, the guideline said.
Bid-based construction project provisions approved
Bid invitations must be issued for construction projects, according to a notice released by the State Council, introducing a range of new provisions.
The National Development and Reform Commission will be in charge of publishing the provisions and deciding when they are to be enforced, said the notice.
Once the provisions are put into force, previous provisions on the scope and threshold of construction projects for bid invitations, approved by the State Council and promulgated by the former State Development Planning Commission in 2000, will be abolished, the document added.
Guideline to boost tourism numbers in designated areas
A State Council guideline to promote region-based tourism will see entire areas identified as tourism destinations with unified planning to develop the sector.
The document aims advance the “tourism plus” program, which promotes industrial integration and explores new functions in region-based tourism. The region-based tourism model should feature diversity and environmental protection, it said.
The document will help develop an integrated, quality oriented and highly regulated tourism ecosystem that can generate maximum benefits.
The guideline emphasized endeavors to broaden tourism to other fields and industries, including integration with urban planning to build tourist towns. Tourism should also work with agriculture, forestry and technologies to develop sightseeing agricultural areas, forest parks and high-end healthcare tourism.
The document aims to explore cultural elements in tourism, improve the quality of traditionally-crafted art products and bring in new technologies for tourism products. Business startups and innovation programs are also encouraged with diverse investment entities welcomed.
According to the guideline, tourism areas are encouraged to enhance service quality, build high-quality branding and introduce smart services such as free Wi-Fi and online booking and payment.
In addition, public facilities should be enhanced. The guideline aims to accelerate the “toilet revolution” and improve the transportation network, consultation service centers in key areas such as traffic hubs and guideposts.
Protection of resources and the environment are also encouraged and poverty alleviation work should be advanced to tap the potential in tourism resources.
The government should provide more policy support in finance, land use and talent, the document added.
Safety the priority as urban rail transit systems grow
The State Council released a guideline on March 23 to guarantee the safe operation of urban rail transit systems.
Over the past few years, the rapidly growing railways and expansion of networks has imposed pressure on operational safety, the guideline said.
Targeting safe operation, relevant departments are required to improve the systems, mechanisms, laws and regulations governing the urban rail transit network. Management should be improved to enhance technological support and service quality. Through these steps, the country should provide the public with safe, reliable, convenient, comfortable and affordable subway services. An integrated management system should also be established. Legislation for urban rail transit systems should be accelerated while laws and regulations should be amended punctually in accordance with new developments. An overall development plan should be drafted. The development of urban rail transit systems should be coordinated in line with local economic and social development.
A dual-prevention mechanism with safety risk control and concealed danger investigations to uncover potential problems should be established. A third-party assessment system should also be established to help improve operational safety.
Rail transit operators should enhance daily security inspections, and new technologies and products should be adopted to conduct security checks in a smart and efficient way. A new security check model focusing on passenger flows should be progressively introduced. Local governments should embrace local urban rail transit systems in the emergency management system. They should also provide more financial support and subsidies to improve operational safety and service quality of their subways.
Four provinces to launch pilot standardization reform
The State Council has approved the launch of national pilot standardization reforms in the provinces of Shanxi, Jiangsu, Shandong and Guangdong, said a document released on March 15.
The document asked the four provincial governments to put a standardization strategy into practice and suggest improvements and identify problems for the comprehensive standardization reform.
The provinces were called to efficiently proceed with the reform to ensure appropriate implementation of policies and measures and the fulfillment of targets.

			CPC issues decision on deepening reform of Party and State institutions





Updated:
Mar 5,2018 4:23 PM
	    Xinhua










BEIJING — A decision by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee on deepening reform of Party and State institutions was made public on March 4.The decision was adopted at the third plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, which was convened from Feb 26 to 28.The document consists of eight parts:— Deeper reform of Party and State institutions is a profound change toward promoting the modernization of the system and capacity for governance of the StateLed by the CPC, China established socialism as its basic system and gradually created the system for the function of Party and State institutions with Chinese characteristics after the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. The Party has actively advanced the reform of Party and State institutions and gradually optimized and standardized their functions, it said.Since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core has worked toward the overall goal of improving and developing the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, while modernizing China’s system and capacity for governance.Faced with new requirements for various tasks in the new era, the current structure and functions of Party and State institutions are not completely suitable for implementing the five-sphere integrated plan and the four-pronged comprehensive strategy, nor for modernizing China’s system and capacity for governance, it said.China has entered a new historic juncture of development. The principal contradiction facing Chinese society has changed. The country will finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020, move on to basically realizing modernization by 2035, and then turn to making China a great modern socialist country in every dimension by the middle of the 21st century.All these urgently require scientific setup of institutions, appropriate allocation of their functions, coordinated usage of staffing and improved systems and mechanism, the document said.— The guiding thought, goals, and principles for deepening reform of Party and State institutionsThe guiding thought is to implement the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, follow the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development, and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.The goals of deepening reform of Party and State institutions include:Establishing a Party and State institutional function system that is well conceived, fully built, procedure based, and efficiently functioning;Forming a CPC leadership system that ensures the Party always provides overall leadership and coordinates the efforts of all involved, a law-based administrative governance system with clear functions and responsibilities, a world-class armed forces system with Chinese characteristics, as well as a sound work system of people’s organizations for bridging and serving the general populace;Promoting coordinated actions and resultant forces among the people’s congresses, governments, political advisory bodies, and supervisory, judicial and prosecutorial organs, people’s organizations, enterprises, public institutions, and social organizations under the unified leadership of the CPC.Deeper reform on the CPC and State institutions will improve China’s governance level and capacity.The reform should follow the principles of sticking to the overall leadership of the Party, committing to a people-centered approach, ensuring optimization, coordination, and high-efficiency as well as ensuring every dimension of governance is law-based.— Improving the system for upholding overall Party leadershipThe Party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country. A primary task of deepening reform of the Party and State institutions is to strengthen the CPC’s leadership in every sector, according to the document.Efforts should be made to establish and improve the institutions and mechanisms by which the Party exercises leadership over major tasks, according to the decision.The Party’s leadership should be strengthened over areas including deeper reform, the rule of law, economy, agriculture and rural work, disciplinary inspection and supervision, organization, publicity, theory and culture, national security, political and legal affairs, united front, ethnic and religious affairs, education, science and technology, cyberspace affairs, foreign affairs and auditing.The reform should also enhance the status of leadership of Party organizations among organizations of the same level, give better play to the role of the Party’s functionary departments, set up Party and government institutions with integrated plans, and advance reform of the Party’s disciplinary inspection and the country’s supervisory systems.— Optimizing the structure and functions of government institutionsThe decision stressed the resolve to remove institutional barriers so that the market plays the decisive role in resource allocation and the government plays its role better.The functions of macro-management institutions should be allocated in a reasonable way. Government functions of antimonopoly and anti-fair competition should be strengthened and optimized. Better functions on financing management are also needed to forestall systemic financial risks and protect financial security, according to the document.It called on efforts to further streamline administration and delegate powers. The direct allocation of market resources by the government and the direct interference in market operations should be reduced to the utmost.It also stressed better systems of market supervision and law enforcement.The reform of natural resources and environmental management systems includes implementing the strictest possible systems for environmental protection and establishing regulatory agencies to manage State-owned natural resource assets and monitor natural ecosystems.The document also outlined measures to improve public services management, strengthen operational and post-operational oversight as well as enhance administrative efficiency and government effectiveness.— Promoting coordinated reforms of institutions in the Party, the government, the military, and people’s organizationsSuch reforms are necessities for strengthening the centralized and unified leadership of the CPC as well as achieving the coordinated and effective functions of these institutions.The reforms include better arrangement of Party and government organs to avoid decentralizing or overlapping responsibilities, reforming the people’s congresses, political advisory bodies, and judicial organs, strengthening the role of people’s organizations as bridges linking the Party and the government with the people, leveraging the role of social organizations, making public institutions better serve public interests and deepening reform in areas covering both the military and civilian services.— Improving the setup of institutions at local levelsIt called for a smooth and vigorous work system of central and local institutions, in which orders are executed without fail.While the central authorities should strengthen macro-management, local authorities were asked to do their jobs well on the condition of carrying out orders from the top to the detail.The setup of local institutions must ensure the effective implementation of the policies from the CPC Central Committee and national laws and regulations, said the document.In the meantime, it pledged to give more decision-making power to organs at and below the provincial level.A lean and effective grassroots governance system should be set up to strengthen the foundation of the system and capacity for governance of the State.Grassroots authorities should not simply copy the structure of their superior level but adapt to their respective responsibilities, said the decision.Coordination between centrally administered agencies and local authorities should also be improved, said the document.— Legalizing the staffing of institutionsThe decision called for managing all organizations and institutions in accordance with the law, and accelerating the process of legalizing the institutions, and their functions, powers, operational procedures as well as responsibilities.The Party shall have its own staffing regulation and there should also be a law on institution staffing, said the decision.While stressing that the staffing rules should be strictly followed, it also called for a dynamic adjustment mechanism and requirements for timely information disclosure.Those who fail to observe the staffing rules and legal requirements would be held accountable.— Enhancing Party’s leadership over deepening reform of Party and State institutionsThe CPC Central Committee should coordinate and supervise the holistic implementation of the reform, while local authorities and departments were urged to resolutely implement the reform tasks, said the decision.Authorities at various levels should not act until their reform plans are approved by the CPC Central Committee.The document said that the whole Party and Chinese people of all ethnic groups should rally closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, achieve unity in thought and action, and ensure that all tasks of deepening reform of Party and State institutions are accomplished.Continued efforts are needed to improve the system of Party and State institutions that are well conceived, fully built, procedure based, and functioning efficiently, said the document.It also called for hard work to secure a decisive victory in finishing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, to speed up the socialist modernization and to realize the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation.

			China unveils action plan for improving rural living environment





Updated:
Feb 6,2018 7:12 AM
	    Xinhua










BEIJING — China’s central authorities on Feb 5 unveiled a three-year action plan to improve the rural living environment.The action plan was jointly released by the General Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council.Improving the rural living environment is an important task for the country to accomplish its goal of building a moderately prosperous society by 2020. It has great significance to the well-being of farmers and harmony of rural society, according to the document.“Although progress has been made, the living environment in rural China is very unbalanced with many areas in the grip of dirt and disorder. It falls far short of people’s expectations and marks a key weakness in social and economic development,” it said.The country aims to make remarkable improvements in the rural living environment by 2020. Villages should be clean and tidy, and residents should have enhanced hygiene and health awareness.The document lists some key tasks including garbage sorting, toilet upgrades, residential sewage treatment and village management.Eastern China and the developed areas in Central and Western China should fully implement these tasks. In the less developed regions in Central and Western China, garbage sorting should be put into place in around 90 percent of villages. About 85 percent of toilets should meet hygiene standards.Remote and underdeveloped regions of the country should meet basic standards of keeping the environment clean and tidy, on the basis of ensuring farmers’ basic living.The authorities told local and central government organs to increase fiscal input. Local governments are encouraged to issue government bonds to improve the environment.Major banks including China Development Bank, Agricultural Development Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and Postal Savings Bank of China are advised to increase credit and loans to support related projects.Private companies are also encouraged to join the plan through standardized implementation of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) schemes and franchised businesses.Although China has become the world’s second-largest economy, some toilets in poor rural areas are still little more than makeshift shelters surrounded by bunches of cornstalks, while others are open pits next to pigsties, leading to problems such as contamination and pollution from human waste.China launched a “toilet revolution” at tourist sites nationwide in 2015 to make such facilities cleaner and more regulated.During the coming three years, authorities aim to add 47,000 toilets and renovate 17,000 at tourist sites, according to a plan released by the China National Tourism Administration.China on Feb 4 released a package of policies under the “No. 1 central document” of the year, charting the road map for the country’s rural vitalization strategy.There is quite a lot to be accomplished in rural areas where opportunities for development have arisen as the country enters a new era, said the document jointly released by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.The “No. 1 central document” is the name traditionally given to the first policy statement of the year released by the central authorities, and is seen as an indicator of policy priorities.

			Policies released on China’s rural vitalization






Updated:
Feb 4,2018 4:47 PM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China released a package of policies under the “No 1 central document” of the year on Feb 4, charting the roadmap for rural vitalization.
There is quite a lot to be accomplished in the rural area where opportunities for development have arisen as the country enters a new era, said the document jointly released by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and State Council.
The “No 1 central document” is the name traditionally given to the first policy statement of the year released by the central authorities, and is seen as an indicator of policy priorities.
The strategy of rural vitalization was first proposed as one of the major aspects of developing a modernized economy in a report delivered to the 19th National Congress of the CPC.
In this latest document, the strategy was described as a “historic task” essential to accomplishing China’s modernization goals and building a moderately prosperous society.
China cannot become modernized without modernizing its agriculture and rural areas, said the document.
The timetable decided by the CPC at a rural conference in December remains unchanged. But the objectives for different stages have become more specific.
By 2020, the strategy should have established an institutional framework and policy system. By then, no Chinese people will live under the existing poverty line, and rural productivity and agricultural supply will improve substantially.
By 2035, “decisive” progress shall be made, with basic modernization of agriculture and rural areas. All Chinese, either in cities or rural areas, will have equal access to basic public services. Urban and rural integration will improve.
By 2050, rural areas should have strong agriculture, a beautiful countryside and well-off farmers.
Han Jun, chief of the Office of the Central Rural Work Leading Group, said the document was “problem-oriented” and a “top-level design” for China to achieve prosperity in rural areas.
“The document not only elaborates on the significance of the strategy, but also sets the tone, specifies the targets and policies and makes requirements for governments at lower levels,” he said.
The document puts a lot of emphasis on the need for proper planning. Local governments have been required to specify their plans according to the local reality, especially for the period from 2018 to 2022, and to coordinate policy-making in relevant spheres.
For instance, in well-developed villages, the priority may be on increasing public services. In villages with a long history and rich natural and cultural resources, development must be done along with protection.
In villages with harsh living conditions and a fragile natural environment, more efforts shall be taken in relocation.
As the Chinese economy is shifting toward high-quality development, China also aims for more competitive agriculture driven by higher productivity and better quality.
According to the document, China will have more high-standard farmland, install more efficient water conservancy facilities, and use more advanced agricultural equipment.
Farm produce will face tougher quality tests while more efforts will be made in the treatment of soil and water pollution.
China will also expand exports of high-quality farm produce and broaden rural cooperation with countries and regions under the Belt and Road Initiative.
More capital will be channeled to rural areas through steadily rising public finance inputs, broadened financing, and better financial institution services.
The package of policies also includes better rural governance, strengthened leadership of the CPC, better education and medical services, improved living facilities such as toilets, and reforms on land use and collective property rights.
This is the 15th year in a row that the “No 1 central document” has been devoted to agriculture, farmers and rural areas.

			Results of Q4 govt website inspection issued






Updated:
Feb 7,2018 10:00 AM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council released a circular on the results of a nationwide inspection of government websites conducted in the fourth quarter of 2017.
As of Dec 1, 24,820 government websites were in operation, including 1,961 affiliated with State Council departments and 32 provincial-level government portal websites.
The State Council’s general office conducted a random inspection of 460 websites, of which 95 percent were qualified. It’s worth noting that the websites of Beijing, Tianjin, Hainan, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps were rated as 100 percent qualified over four consecutive quarters. 
All provincial regions and 71 departments of the State Council selected 12,336 websites under their respective administrations, which accounted for 50 percent of government websites with a 96 percent total qualification rate.
Valid messages via platforms for people to mention errors on government websites totaled 14,208 in the fourth quarter, among which 99 percent were answered. For 25 websites selected from the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Shanghai, Hunan, the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the figure reached 100 percent.
Also during the same period, 116 officials were punished or received warnings for running unqualified websites. 
In 2017, all regions and departments had inspected 43,139 government websites at all levels. A total of 21,513 websites with poor maintenance were integrated or migrated and 625 officials were held accountable for the substandard websites.
Some problems surfaced in the process, such as unregulated domain names and logos, lack of overall rectification measures, poor interactions with netizens and insufficient security control.
Based on the results of the inspection, the circular urged more efforts to supervise government websites and to provide better government services online. 
Regions and departments at all levels should enhance regular website supervision, operationalize correction measures, better interact with netizens to address their concerns, and improve security mechanisms to ensure government websites are safe and reliable.

	    english.gov.cn












The Chinese government vowed more support for the country’s basic science research, as the global competition in this field is reliant on basic research, according to a document released by the State Council on Jan 31.
The goal is to enhance China’s initial innovation capability and build a solid foundation for a world technology power. 
According to the document, by 2035, China should lead the world in more key fields in science and make breakthroughs that are significant for global scientific development.
More support will be provided for key basic subjects such as mathematics and physics, as well as cutting-edge research in basic science, involving universe evolution, the origin of life, brain science and cognition, quantum science and deep-ocean science.
The government will make better use of the national natural science fund to facilitate basic science and cutting-edge research, and encourage sharing the results. It will also encourage local authorities, enterprises and social organizations to provide more support for basic science research.
Beijing, Shanghai and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area will be supported to build scientific innovation centers with international influence. 
Major scientific infrastructure will be constructed, covering a variety of fields such as energy, life, earth system and environment, materials, particle physics, nuclear physics and astronomy.
National laboratories will be built for research on major trans-subjects and strategic science projects, which will engage the best teams and innovation resources around the country. 
The document underlines the significance of training and absorbing more talent for basic science research, especially leading figures and young scientists. 
China will continue to participate in international “big science” programs initiated by other countries while mapping out its own cooperation plans. In addition, China will encourage overseas experts to lead or participate in national scientific projects.

			China to beef up quality certification system






Updated:
Jan 26,2018 4:07 PM
	    english.gov.cn












To boost supply-side structural reform and administrative streamlining, China is stepping up efforts to boost quality by enhancing the quality certification system and quality management, according to a circular recently released by the State Council.
As a basic principle, a unified and top-level plan is required, with no possibility for industry monopoly or market barriers. The market should play a decisive role in supply and demand with governmental guidance. 
Meanwhile, compulsory and voluntary certification should be combined to call up efforts from all walks of life to enhance quality management.
These efforts are aimed at building a sound quality certification system in three to five years, with improved quality in primary products, projects, services, consumer goods and food, and some internally competitive brands.
International advanced quality management standards will be adopted, such as the new ISO 9001. Companies should be encouraged to enhance quality management using these standards, which are to be introduced throughout the industry and social governance.
Governments at all levels are expected to employ the quality management system to transform their management styles with better administration efficiency and credibility.
Efforts will be made to spread the quality certification system to different enterprises with necessary and compulsory certification in place for products concerning security, health, and environment under the rules of the World Trade Organization. 
The quality of new technologies, products and business models should be supervised in an inclusive but prudent way in order to foster new economic drivers and bolster industrial transformation.
Apart from the unified certification system, other redundant certifications and related charges should be cleaned up. Certification institutions should provide an integrated solution from test to certification, to lower costs for enterprises.
Moreover, a supervision system involving different parties will be enhanced, and international cooperation is encouraged for mutual recognition of quality certification.

			China to make cities safer






Updated:
Jan 7,2018 8:50 PM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China unveiled a guideline to push for safe development of cities, as some major accidents in cities caused great casualties and property loss in recent years on Jan 7.
The country must uphold the vision of making development people-centered and never seek development at the cost of safety, according to the guideline made public by the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.
By 2020, China aims to achieve “noticeable progress” in safe urban development, and create a number of demonstration cities in line with the objectives for becoming a moderately prosperous society in all respects, the guideline said.
By 2035, the country should put in place an improved system for safe urban development and create safe cities that are in line with the requirements for basically realizing socialist modernization, it added.
With the acceleration of China’s urbanization, the population, functions and sizes of Chinese cities have been expanding rapidly, but safety hazards are also on the rise as cities become more complicated.
At the end of 2016, the ratio of permanent urban residents to total population stood at 57.35 percent, up from 52.57 percent at the end of 2012, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.
The country must raise the capability of ensuring urban safety and prevent major accidents to create a sound environment for people’s lives and work, according to the guideline.
The notion of safe development should be reflected in making plans for cities, including those for urban social and economic development and for disaster prevention and relief.
For residential areas, commercial areas, development zones, industrial parks and port areas, safety must be the prerequisite in determining their spatial layouts, the guideline said.
Safety-related laws, regulations and standards should be improved to raise the country’s ability to ward off risks and ensure the safe functioning of urban facilities, it said.
“Safety must be put in the first place in urban infrastructure construction,” according to the guideline.
China should push forward the construction of multi-functional underground pipeline corridors in an orderly manner, and reinforce the safety supervision of the construction and operation of transport, water, drainage, heating, natural gas and other infrastructure projects.
China should also strengthen safety risk control by thoroughly identifying urban safety risks, building a risk information management platform and drawing a map for the distribution of such risks in four tiers, with red representing the most severe, followed by orange, yellow and blue.
The screening and overhaul of urban safety hazards will be standardized by further improving the mechanism for the identification, registration and supervision of major sources of dangers, building a database for dynamic management and raising the online supervision capacity, the guideline said.
Emergency management and rescue capabilities will be reinforced, as the country will pursue fast, scientific and effective rescue efforts, improve the emergency rescue management in cities and push for information sharing and coordination of different departments.
The guideline also detailed measures on raising the country’s safety supervision efficiency, making cities better at ensuring safety and improving leadership and coordination.

Updated:
Dec 25,2017 5:05 PM
	    english.gov.cn










The State Council has approved the overall urban plan (2017-2035) for Shanghai, one of four municipalities directly under the central government.Being a noted historic and cultural city, Shanghai is also a center of international economy, finance, trade, shipping and technological innovation. Therefore, the construction of Shanghai should undertake a bigger role to serve the Belt and Road Initiative and the Yangtze River economic belt, striding ahead in deepening reform and opening-up.Urban construction should be aimed at building Shanghai into a distinguished global city and a socialist cosmopolis, according to the plan.Shanghai’s layout should be in line with the strategy of expanding ecological space, saving enough agricultural land while optimizing the urban space. An integral system should be established to balance the development of downtown area, new towns and villages. Meanwhile, it should enhance coordination with surrounding cities to constitute a world-class city group.The city’s scale will be tightly controlled. It is emphasized that the population of permanent residents should be capped at 25 million by 2035, while the overall construction land will be limited to 3,200 square kilometers. Certain space can be set aside for further adjustment.Priority is also given to ecological environment protection. More efforts should be made to weed out backward production capacity, reduce pollutant emissions, enhance protection of water areas and green land, and build a water-saving city and a sponge city, according to the circular.The central government also urges Shanghai to create a better habitation environment. Public services involving education, culture, sports, healthcare and elderly care should be improved. Residential land and its supporting infrastructure should be reasonably arranged regarding population distribution. Increasing housing supplies through multiple channels is encouraged, and comprehensive governance over urban and rural environment will be strengthened.In addition, the Shanghai government is asked to explore its cultural characteristics to promote its soft power. Historical relics need continued protection, and the buildings in important areas need a careful design to present a blended style of traditional cultures, as well as of nature, and modernization. Moreover, the city infrastructure should be constructed for security, green protection, and convenience. As Shanghai is a traffic hub, infrastructure such as roads, railways, airports and ports should be improved to facilitate regional transportation. Risk control measures need great attention to guard against disasters and emerging events.A new governing mechanism for the mega city is stressed in the circular. The rule of law is set to be boosted in city governance. Internet and big data will be introduced to promote a scientific and smart administration. Local governments should also search for solutions from citizens, encouraging them to participate in city governance.Finally, the State Council urges the Shanghai government to strictly follow the plan and maintain solid implementation. Supervision will be enhanced over the whole construction period.

			China to appoint ‘lake chiefs’ to control pollution





Updated:
Jan 5,2018 7:09 AM
	    Xinhua










BEIJING — China will appoint “lake chiefs” to step up water pollution control as a similar approach adopted in 2016 to protect rivers has achieved satisfactory results.A four-tier system of lake chiefs comprising provincial, city, county and township chiefs will be established by the end of 2018 to cover all lakes, according to a document released on Jan 4 by the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.Lake chiefs will be tasked with resource protection, pollution prevention and control, and environmental restoration in waters under their supervision. Their performance will be assessed and they will be held accountable for environmental damage.China started to appoint river chiefs more than a year ago, and there are now around 200,000.The effect is clear. East China’s Zhejiang province has basically eliminated black waters and it has said it will deal with any water “below Grade V,” the lowest acceptable level in China’s water quality grading system.Lake chiefs will address waters not covered by river chiefs.

Enterprises are encouraged to engage in the operation of vocational schools and colleges through various structures such as sole proprietorships and joint ventures. They are also encouraged to take part in curriculum reform, scientific research and accept more students as interns.
Vocational schools are encouraged to align with enterprises so that students can receive more training. Technology professionals and managers from enterprises are encouraged to teach in vocational schools and colleges.
Enterprises, research institutions and social organizations are encouraged to join the management of vocational schools and colleges.

			China to expand pilot reform in ecological damage compensation






Updated:
Dec 17,2017 9:36 PM
	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China will expand a pilot reform nationwide starting next year, obliging polluters to repair the environment or pay a compensation.
The decision was contained in a document issued on Dec 17 by the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.
By 2020, China aims to establish an efficient comprehensive damage compensation system to protect and improve the country’s ecosystem.
Under the system, individuals or companies that cause environmental damage shall have to help restore the environment. If the damages are beyond restoration, they must pay for losses, a process that will be managed by local governments as non-tax revenue.
The system does not apply to marine ecological and environmental damages, which is governed by the marine environment protection law.
The reform has already been piloted in Jilin, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hunan, Chongqing, Guizhou and Yunnan, with notable progress made, according to the document.
Commenting on the decision, an official at the Ministry of Environmental Protection told Xinhua that conditions for legislation on ecological damage compensation were not ripe, but expanding the pilot scheme nationwide would help accumulate experiences for the legislative work.
The ministry will also work to develop an environmental damage assessment system and regulate the assessment procedures.
China has launched a series of campaigns to fight pollution and environmental degradation, as authorities rectify practices that boost economic growth at environmental cost.
Thousands of officials have been held accountable for environmental damage, following inspections by central authorities.
The country has reduced the use of coal by industries and households and taken bold moves to encourage the use of new energy as well as cleaner fuel energy such as natural gas.

			New year, new laws that add ecological protections to air, water


		Zheng Jinran

Jan 2,2018 10:14 AM
	    China Daily










A batch of laws and regulations to benefit people’s livelihoods, including the country’s first environmental protection tax, rules on takeout foods and tour guide services, went into effect on Jan 1.The new laws and regulations were issued by the National People’s Congress, the top legislative body, and central government ministries.Among the new measures, environmental protection has been a major area, with two laws and a reform plan that took effect on Jan 1. They include an environmental protection tax, a water pollution prevention and control law and the compensation reform plan on ecological and environmental damage.The tax is China’s first with the aim of protecting the environment. It is designed to regulate companies that discharge pollutants by using economic measures, said Wang Jinnan, head of the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning.China already had a regulation on collecting a “pollutant discharge fee”. But some local governments exploited loopholes and exempted enterprises that are big contributors to revenue. For years, regulators suggested replacing the fee system with a law to better regulate the companies and governments.Once the new tax is levied, companies will pay the price based on the amount of pollutants they discharge. They also will earn a reduction if they adopt advanced technologies to reduce pollution.In addition, the law on water pollution control highlighted the “river chief” system, which makes the government leaders the point people to coordinate control measures. Combined with other laws, this “could help make pollution control more effective and make enforcement stronger”, Li Ganjie, minister of environmental protection, said while introducing the law on Dec 26.Besides a cleaner environment, other aspects of people’s lives also will be improved under the new laws and regulations.The new Tour Guide Management Regulation bans tour guides from forcing visitors to buy items or bullying them with curses. Those who violate the regulation will face severe punishment, including fines and revoked licenses.Under another new regulation, employers that fail to pay migrant workers their wages on time will be added to a blacklist. This also would apply if a wage debt to workers leads to mass disturbances.It will restrict them in many ways, such as applying for loans or getting licenses, said Wang Cheng, head of labor inspection at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.The joint restriction will be a major measure to protect migrant workers’ interests and deter violators, he added.In addition, laws and regulations on nuclear safety, unfair competition in market and management of public libraries also took effective with the start of 2018.

For 17 websites picked from the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the figure reached 100 percent.During the third quarter, all regions and departments had strengthened efforts to bolster the accountability mechanisms of disqualified government websites and staff, and a number of persons in charge received punishments for breach of duty. Meanwhile, regulations on administration, intensive construction, and service levels were also high on the agenda.Some problems surfaced in the process, such as unregulated website titles, absence of key portals, deficiencies in functionality and mistakes induced by substandard day-to-day operations.Based on the results of the inspection, the circular urged stepping up the development and management of government websites and offering people an efficient and convenient access to e-governments.Regions and departments at all levels should advance the administration for the titles and domain names of government websites. Efforts should also be made to make timely replies and solutions to the messages left by netizens, the circular stressed.Regions and departments are expected to report the rectifications of their substandard regulations on websites to the General Office of the State Council no later than Dec 20, according to the circular.

The State Council has approved a revised version of the overall urban plan (2006-2020) for Mudanjiang, a city in Northeast China’s Heilongjiang province.
Located in the southeast part of the province, Mudanjiang plays an important role in the region as a tourist attraction. 
According to the plan issued on Sept 19, urban and rural areas of the city should be managed in a coordinated way. Management of forest regions and rural-urban fringe should be strengthened. Public utilities and infrastructure in urban areas should provide service to the surrounding villages.
Land for construction in Mudanjiang should be limited to 90 square kilometers by 2020, with the downtown population set at under 900,000. No economic development zones or new areas are allowed to be built outside the planned construction area. Land should be preserved and developed in an efficient way. Forest and farmland should be effectively protected.
Improving the city’s infrastructure is emphasized in the plan. More highways, railways, and parking lots should be built. Underground infrastructure should be improved with the construction of an upgraded water supply, drainage facilities and utility tunnel. The alarm system and prevention facilities for disasters should be improved, especially for forest fires and water-logging. 
The State Council plans to build an energy-saving and environmentally friendly city out of Mudanjiang, cutting its backward capacity, controlling pollutant emissions and promoting bio-safe disposal of waste. The plan also advocates the efficient use of water, developing green architecture, and protecting nature reserves, wetlands, water sources and scenic spots, such as Jingpo Lake.
People’s living conditions should be improved by providing more quality public services in education, healthcare and civil affairs. Construction of low-cost housing should be ensured. Shantytowns, urban villages and dangerous buildings should be renovated and improved.
The city’s historic sites should be protected, especially its traditional landscape and structure, according to the plan.

			China establishes environmental-capacity alert system





Updated:
Sep 21,2017 8:33 AM
	    Xinhua










BEIJING — The Chinese government announced on Sept 20 that it had built an alert system to monitor regional environmental and resource capacity conditions, and punish those responsible for environmental damage.Regions with serious environmental and resource capacity overloading will not be allowed to start new projects, according to a document issued by the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council on Sept 20.The new system will divide environmental capacity conditions into three levels: overloading, near overloading and not overloading.Meanwhile, based on actual resources or environmental losses, regions facing capacity overloading will be issued with a red or orange alert, while regions close to capacity overloading will be issued with a yellow or blue alert.Regions whose environmental capacities are without excessive pollution and resource loss will be labeled green non-alert zones.For red-alert areas, government authorities will stop granting approval on relevant projects, while enterprises causing severe environmental and resource destruction will face punishment, including fines, production restrictions and shutdowns.Deadlines will be set for these regions to improve local environmental capacity conditions to below the red-alert level.Individuals, such as owners of polluting enterprises or those in local authorities with slack supervision, will be held accountable for the environmental damage and even be prosecuted for criminal liability.The government will also work to provide compensation to green non-alert zones for their ecological protection efforts and development rights, as well as increasing green financing support.The document also put forward detailed management measures for specific fields such as water resources, land resources and the marine environment.China has said “no more” to economic growth at the price of the environment, by putting environmental protection at the top of the agenda to ensure greener, more sustainable development.The country has introduced action plans to fight air, water and soil pollution and rolled out its harshest-ever environmental protection law.An ecological “red line” strategy will also be implemented to put certain regions under mandatory and rigorous protection.

			China to carry out nation-wide investigation on pollutants






Updated:
Sep 21,2017 5:00 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council released a circular providing guidelines for the second nation-wide investigation on pollutants, which is scheduled to be carried out on Dec 31.
The probe is aimed at strengthening supervision on pollution, enhancing environmental quality, and reinforcing pollutants-related risk control.
The investigation will mainly target SOEs, institutions and private entities that produce industrial, agricultural, residential and mobile pollutant sources, or possess concentrated pollutant treatment facilities. 
Specific investigation process will be required for each category of pollutants, with three major steps involved - registration of basic information on the targeted entity, comprehensive analysis based on the actual measurement and a preliminary calculation on the production and emission of the pollutants. Further steps will be taken according to the results.
All targeted entities, especially those heavy polluting ones, should carry out self-monitoring, and report the annual results honestly. Related departments should make investigation accordingly, while encouraging social entities such as sci-tech institutions, colleges and environment consultancy agencies, and the public, to participate in such activity. 
An efficient management and supervision system will be established to crack down on illegal activities.
The main probe includes a series of work such as individual survey, data collection and check and quality evaluation, which will be carried out in 2018, with preliminary work to be finished by 2017. Final results will be summarized and released in 2019.
According to the circular, expense on the investigation will be shouldered by central and local financial departments separately.

Updated:

	    Xinhua












BEIJING — China will make environmental monitoring data more objective and accurate with rules against data manipulation.
By 2020, China will have a system in place that ensures the quality of environmental data and management mechanisms, according to the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council on Sept 21.
Some officials have interfered with data, while data reported by different monitoring agencies often has different standards, leading to poor data quality, the document said.
By clarifying responsibilities and unifying standards, the independence of environmental monitoring agencies and the authenticity of data will be ensured.
Officials who manipulate or fake data will be punished, while individuals in monitoring agencies will be responsible for the accuracy of data they collect or analyze.
In another attempt to protect the environment, an alert system to monitor regional environmental and resource capacity conditions was announced on Sept 20.
Regions with serious environmental and resource capacity overloading will not be allowed to start new projects.

			State Council approves Fuxin’s city plan






Updated:
Sep 22,2017 4:57 PM
	    english.gov.cn












The State Council has approved the urban plan (2001-2020) for Fuxin, a city in Northeast China’s Liaoning province.
Located in northwestern Liaoning, Fuxin is an important base for the equipment manufacturing industry.
According to the plan, urban and rural areas in the city should be developed in a coordinated way. In the designated area of 1,955 square kilometers, an integrated construction with common infrastructure and public service facilities of urban and rural areas is required. Priority will be given to develop counties and potential towns, and villages will receive more guidance in layout.
By 2020, the downtown population will be limited to 730,000, and urban construction area restricted to 83.35 square kilometers. Land should be utilized intensively, with underground space properly developed and farmland well-preserved.
In addition, the State Council urges Fuxin to establish a comprehensive transportation system and prompt the construction of parking lots. Constructing pipelines and other infrastructure for water supply and drainage, as well as garbage disposal, should be carried out proactively. 
Moreover, a disaster prevention system, including early warning and relief facilities, should be improved.
The State Council also called for a prompt reduction of backward capacity and restraint in pollutant emissions. Greener efforts should be made to beef up the construction of sponge city and energy-saving buildings, and the protection of ecological resorts such as nature reserves and wetlands.
To create a harmonious living environment for people, construction of subsidized apartments and shantytown reconstruction will be stepped up. Restoration of deserted industrial sites is also in the pipeline in favor of an organic renewal of the city.
The local government is also asked to preserve historic relics in city construction, creating a harmonious mingling of natural and cultural landscapes.
